We also have additional Android-related information: General Android Overview and Recommendations GrapheneOS vs CalyxOS Comparison AOSP Derivatives \u00b6 We recommend installing one of these custom Android operating systems on your device, listed in order of preference, depending on your device's compatibility with these operating systems. Note End-of-life devices (such as GrapheneOS or CalyxOS's \"extended support\" devices) do not have full security patches (firmware updates) due to the OEM discontinuing support. These devices cannot be considered completely secure regardless of installed software. GrapheneOS \u00b6 Recommendation GrapheneOS is the best choice when it comes to privacy and security. GrapheneOS provides additional security hardening and privacy improvements. It has a hardened memory allocator , network and sensor permissions, and various other security features . GrapheneOS also comes with full firmware updates and signed builds, so verified boot is fully supported. Homepage Privacy Policy GrapheneOS supports Sandboxed Google Play , which runs Google Play Services fully sandboxed like any other regular app. This means you can take advantage of most Google Play Services, such as push notifications , while giving you full control over their permissions and access, and while containing them to a specific work profile or user profile of your choice. Google Pixel phones are the only devices that currently meet GrapheneOS's hardware security requirements . CalyxOS \u00b6 Recommendation CalyxOS is a system with some privacy features on top of AOSP , including Datura firewall, Signal integration in the dialer app, and a built in panic button. CalyxOS also comes with firmware updates and signed builds, so verified boot is fully supported. Homepage Privacy Policy For people who need Google Play Services, CalyxOS optionally includes microG . CalyxOS also includes alternate location services, Mozilla and DejaVu . CalyxOS only supports Google Pixel phones. However, support for the OnePlus 8T/9 and Fairphone 4 is currently in beta . DivestOS \u00b6 Recommendation DivestOS is a soft- fork of LineageOS . DivestOS inherits many supported devices from LineageOS. It has signed builds, making it possible to have verified boot on some non-Pixel devices. Homepage Privacy Policy DivestOS has automated kernel vulnerability ( CVE ) patching , fewer proprietary blobs, a custom hosts file, and F-Droid as the app store. It includes UnifiedNlp for network location. Its hardened WebView, Mulch , enables CFI for all architectures and includes network state partitioning . DivestOS also includes kernel patches from GrapheneOS and enables all available kernel security features via defconfig hardening . All kernels newer than version 3.4 include full page sanitization and all ~22 Clang-compiled kernels have -ftrivial-auto-var-init=zero enabled. DivestOS implements some system hardening patches originally developed for GrapheneOS. DivestOS 16.0, 17.1, and 18.1 implements GrapheneOS's INTERNET permission toggle, hardened memory allocator , exec-spawning , JNI constification , and partial bionic hardening patchsets. 17.1 and 18.1 feature GrapheneOS's per-network full MAC randomization option, and ptrace_scope control, and automatic reboot/Wi-Fi/Bluetooth timeout options . Warning DivestOS firmware update status and quality control varies across the devices it supports. We still recommend GrapheneOS or CalyxOS depending on your device's compatibility. For other devices, DivestOS is a good alternative. Not all of the supported devices have verified boot, and some perform it better than others. Android Devices \u00b6 Avoid buying phones from mobile network operators. These often have a locked bootloader and do not support OEM unlocking . These phone variants will prevent you from installing any kind of alternative Android distribution. Be very careful about buying second hand phones from online marketplaces. Always check the reputation of the seller. If the device is stolen there's a possibility of IMEI blacklisting . There is also a risk involved with you being associated with the activity of the previous owner. A few more tips regarding Android devices and operating system compatibility: Do not buy devices that have reached or are near their end-of-life, additional firmware updates must be provided by the manufacturer. Do not buy preloaded LineageOS or /e/ OS phones or any Android phones without proper Verified Boot support and firmware updates. These devices also have no way for you to check whether they've been tampered with. In short, if a device or Android distribution is not listed here, there is probably a good reason, so check our discussions page. Google Pixel \u00b6 Recommendation Google Pixel devices are known to have good security and properly support Verified Boot , even when installing custom operating systems. Beginning with the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro , Pixel devices receive a minimum of 5 years of guaranteed security updates, ensuring a much longer lifespan compared to the 2-4 years competing OEMs typically offer. Store Unless you have a need for specific CalyxOS features that are unavailable on GrapheneOS, we strongly recommend GrapheneOS over other operating system choices on Pixel devices. The installation of GrapheneOS on a Pixel phone is easy with their web installer . If you don't feel comfortable doing it yourself and are willing to spend a bit of extra money, check out the NitroPhone as they come preloaded with GrapheneOS from the reputable Nitrokey company. A few more tips for purchasing a Google Pixel: If you're after a bargain on a Pixel device, we suggest buying an \" a \" model, just after the next flagship is released. Discounts are usually available because Google will be trying to clear their stock. Consider price beating options and specials offered at brick and mortar stores. Look at online community bargain sites in your country. These can alert you to good sales. Google provides a list showing the support cycle for each one of their devices. The price per day for a device can be calculated as: \\(\\text{Cost} \\over \\text {EOL Date }-\\text{ Current Date}\\) , meaning that the longer use of the device the lower cost per day. Other Devices \u00b6 Important Google Pixel phones are the only devices we recommend for purchase. Pixel phones have stronger hardware security than any other Android devices currently on the market, due to proper AVB support for third party operating systems and Google's custom Titan security chips acting as the Secure Element. Secure Elements are more limited than the processor's Trusted Execution Environment used by most other phones as they are only used for secrets storage, hardware attestation and rate limiting but not running \"trusted\" programs. Phones without a Secure Element have to use the TEE for secrets storage, rate limiting, and trusted computing, which results in a larger attack surface . The following OEMs are only mentioned as they have phones compatible with the operating systems recommended by us. If you are purchasing a new device, we only recommend purchasing a Google Pixel. When purchasing a device, we recommend getting one as new as possible. The software and firmware of mobile devices are only supported for a limited time, so buying new extends that lifespan as much as possible. OnePlus \u00b6 If you are unable to obtain a Google Pixel, recent OnePlus devices are the next best option if you want to run a custom OS without privileged Play Services. OnePlus 8 and later devices will receive 4 years of security updates from their initial launch date. CalyxOS has experimental support for the OnePlus 8T and 9 . DivestOS has support for most OnePlus devices up to the OnePlus 7T Pro , with varying levels of support. Fairphone \u00b6 Danger The Fairphone 3 and 4 are not secure by default, as the stock bootloader trusts the public AVB signing key . This breaks verified boot on a stock Fairphone device, as the system will boot alternative Android operating systems such (such as /e/) without any warning about custom operating system usage. This problem is somewhat mitigated when you install a custom operating system such as CalyxOS or DivestOS and trust the developer's signing keys rather than the stock system keys, however a vulnerability in CalyxOS or DivestOS's recovery environments could still potentially allow an attacker to bypass AVB . To reiterate, you must install a custom operating system with custom boot keys to use Fairphone devices in a secure manner. CalyxOS has experimental support for the Fairphone 4 . DivestOS has builds available for the Fairphone 3 . Fairphone markets their devices as receiving 6 years of support. However, the SoC (Qualcomm Snapdragon 750G on the Fairphone 4) has a considerably shorter EOL date. This means that firmware security updates from Qualcomm for the Fairphone 4 will end in September 2023, regardless of whether Fairphone continues to release software security updates. General Apps \u00b6 Orbot \u00b6 Recommendation Orbot is a free proxy app that routes your connections through the Tor Network. Homepage Downloads Google Play f-droid F-Droid Source Source Orbot can proxy individual apps if they support SOCKS or HTTP proxying. It can also proxy all your network connections using VpnService and can be used with the VPN killswitch in Settings \u2192 Network & internet \u2192 VPN \u2192 \u2192 Block connections without VPN . For resistance against traffic analysis attacks, consider enabling Isolate Destination Address in \u2192 Settings \u2192 Connectivity . This will use a completely different Tor Circuit (different middle relay and exit nodes) for every domain you connect to. Tip Orbot is often outdated on the Guardian Project's F-Droid repository and Google Play so consider downloading directly from the GitHub repository instead. All versions are signed using the same signature so they should be compatible with each other. Shelter \u00b6 Recommendation Shelter is an app that helps you leverage the Android work profile to isolate other apps. Shelter supports blocking contact search cross profiles and sharing files across profiles via the default file manager ( DocumentsUI ). Project Info Downloads Google Play f-droid F-Droid Source Warning As CalyxOS includes a device controller, we recommend using their built in work profile instead. Shelter is recommended over Insular and Island as it supports contact search blocking . When using Shelter, you are placing complete trust in its developer as Shelter would be acting as a Device Admin for the work profile and has extensive access to the data stored within it. Auditor \u00b6 Recommendation Auditor is an app which leverages hardware security features to provide device integrity monitoring for supported devices . Currently it works with GrapheneOS and the device's stock operating system. Website Downloads Google Play Source Auditor performs attestation and intrusion detection by: Using a Trust On First Use (TOFU) model between an auditor and auditee , the pair establish a private key in the hardware-backed keystore of the Auditor . The auditor can either be another instance of the Auditor app or the Remote Attestation Service . The auditor records the current state and configuration of the auditee . Should tampering with the operating system of the auditee after the pairing is complete, the auditor will be aware of the change in the device state and configurations. You will be alerted to the change. No personally identifiable information is submitted to the attestation service. We recommend that you sign up with an anonymous account and enable remote attestation for continuous monitoring. If your threat model requires privacy you could consider using Orbot or a VPN to hide your IP address from the attestation service. To make sure that your hardware and operating system is genuine, perform local attestation immediately after the device has been installed and prior to any internet connection. Secure Camera \u00b6 Recommendation Secure Camera is an camera app focused on privacy and security which can capture images, videos, and QR codes. CameraX vendor extensions (Portrait, HDR, Night Sight, Face Retouch, and Auto) are also supported on available devices. Source Code Downloads Google Play Source Main privacy features include: Auto removal of Exif metadata (enabled by default) Use of the new Media API, therefore storage permissions are not required Microphone permission not required unless you want to record sound Note Metadata is not currently deleted from video files but that is planned. The image orientation metadata is not deleted. If you enable location (in Secure Camera) that won't be deleted either. If you want to delete that later you will need to use an external app such as Scrambled Exif . Secure PDF Viewer \u00b6 Recommendation Secure PDF Viewer is a PDF viewer based on pdf.js that doesn't require any permissions. The PDF is fed into a sandboxed webview . This means that it doesn't require permission directly to access content or files. Content-Security-Policy is used to enforce that the JavaScript and styling properties within the WebView are entirely static content. App Info Downloads Google Play Source PrivacyBlur \u00b6 Recommendation PrivacyBlur is a free app which can blur sensitive portions of pictures before sharing them online. Website Downloads Google Play f-droid F-Droid Source Warning You should never use blur to redact text in images . If you want to redact text in an image, draw a box over the text. For this we suggest Pocket Paint or Imagepipe . Obtaining Applications \u00b6 GrapheneOS App Store \u00b6 GrapheneOS's app store is available on GitHub . It supports Android 12 and above and is capable of updating itself. The app store has standalone applications built by the GrapheneOS project such as the Auditor , Camera , and PDF Viewer . If you are looking for these applications, we highly recommend that you get them from GrapheneOS's app store instead of the Play Store, as the apps on their store are signed by the GrapheneOS's project own signature that Google does not have access to. Aurora Store \u00b6 The Google Play Store requires a Google account to login which is not great for privacy. The Aurora Store (a Google Play Store proxy) does not, and works most of the time. F-Droid \u00b6 F-Droid is often recommended as an alternative to Google Play, particularly in the privacy community. The option to add third party repositories and not be confined to Google's walled garden has led to its popularity. F-Droid additionally has reproducible builds for some applications, and is dedicated to free and open source software. However, there are problems with the official F-Droid client, their quality control, and how they build, sign and deliver packages, outlined in this post . Sometimes the official F-Droid repository may fall behind on updates. F-Droid maintainers reuse package IDs while signing apps with their own keys, which is not ideal as it does give the F-Droid team ultimate trust. The Google Play version of some apps may contain unwanted telemetry or lack features that are available in the F-Droid version. We have these general tips: Check if the app developers have their own F-Droid repository first, e.g. Bitwarden , Samourai Wallet , or Newpipe , which have their own repositories with less telemetry, additional features or faster updates. This is the ideal situation and you should be using these repositories if possible. Check if an app is available on the IzzyOnDroid repository. The IzzyOnDroid repository pulls builds directly from GitHub and is the next best thing to the developers' own repositories. We recommend that you download the GitHub builds and install them manually first, then use IzzyOnDroid for any subsequent updates. This will ensure that the signature of the applications you get from IzzyOnDroid matches that of the developer and the packages have not been tampered with. Check if there are any differences between the F-Droid version and the Google Play Store version. Some applications like IVPN do not include certain features (eg AntiTracker ) in their Google Play Store build out of fear of censorship by Google. Evaluate whether the additional features in the F-Droid build are worth the slower updates. Also think about whether faster updates from the Google Play Store are worth the potential privacy issues in your threat model . Neo Store \u00b6 The official F-Droid client targets a low API level and does not utilize the seamless updates feature introduced in Android 12. Targeting lower API levels means that the F-Droid client cannot take advantage of the new improvements in the application sandboxes that comes with higher API levels. For automatic updates to work, the F-Droid client requires that the Privileged Extension be included in the operating system, granting it more privileges than what a normal app would have, which is not great for security. To mitigate these problems, we recommend Neo Store as it supports seamless updates on Android 12 and above without needing any special privileges and targets a higher API level. Recommendation Neo Store is a modern F-Droid client made with MaterialUI, forked from Foxy Droid . Unlike the official F-Droid client, Neo Store supports seamless updates on Android 12 and above without the need for a privileged extension. If your Android distribution is on Android 12 or above and does not include the F-Droid privileged extension , it is highly recommended that you use Neo Store instead of the official client. Downloads APK Download Source Manually with RSS Notifications \u00b6 If an app is released on a platform like GitHub, you may be able to add an RSS feed to your news aggregator that will help you be aware of new releases. Using Secure Camera as an example, you would navigate to its releases page on GitHub and append .atom to the URL: https://github.com/GrapheneOS/Camera/releases.atom Verifying APK Fingerprints \u00b6 If you download APK files to install manually, you can verify their signature with the apksigner tool, which is a part of Android build-tools . Install Java JDK . Download the Android Studio command line tools . Extract the downloaded archive: unzip commandlinetools-*.zip cd cmdline-tools ./bin/sdkmanager --sdk_root = ./ \"build-tools;29.0.3\" Run the signature verification command: ./build-tools/29.0.3/apksigner verify --print-certs ../Camera-37.apk The resulting hashes can then be compared with another source. Some developers such as Signal show the fingerprints on their website.

This problem is somewhat mitigated when you install a custom operating system such as CalyxOS or DivestOS and trust the developer's signing keys rather than the stock system keys, however a vulnerability in CalyxOS or DivestOS's recovery environments could still potentially allow an attacker to bypass AVB . To reiterate, you must install a custom operating system with custom boot keys to use Fairphone devices in a secure manner. CalyxOS has experimental support for the Fairphone 4 . DivestOS has builds available for the Fairphone 3 . Fairphone markets their devices as receiving 6 years of support. However, the SoC (Qualcomm Snapdragon 750G on the Fairphone 4) has a considerably shorter EOL date.

The option to add third party repositories and not be confined to Google's walled garden has led to its popularity. F-Droid additionally has reproducible builds for some applications, and is dedicated to free and open source software. However, there are problems with the official F-Droid client, their quality control, and how they build, sign and deliver packages, outlined in this post . Sometimes the official F-Droid repository may fall behind on updates. F-Droid maintainers reuse package IDs while signing apps with their own keys, which is not ideal as it does give the F-Droid team ultimate trust. The Google Play version of some apps may contain unwanted telemetry or lack features that are available in the F-Droid version. We have these general tips: Check if the app developers have their own F-Droid repository first, e.g. Bitwarden , Samourai Wallet , or Newpipe , which have their own repositories with less telemetry, additional features or faster updates. This is the ideal situation and you should be using these repositories if possible. Check if an app is available on the IzzyOnDroid repository. The IzzyOnDroid repository pulls builds directly from GitHub and is the next best thing to the developers' own repositories. We recommend that you download the GitHub builds and install them manually first, then use IzzyOnDroid for any subsequent updates. This will ensure that the signature of the applications you get from IzzyOnDroid matches that of the developer and the packages have not been tampered with. Check if there are any differences between the F-Droid version and the Google Play Store version. Some applications like IVPN do not include certain features (eg AntiTracker ) in their Google Play Store build out of fear of censorship by Google. Evaluate whether the additional features in the F-Droid build are worth the slower updates. Also think about whether faster updates from the Google Play Store are worth the potential privacy issues in your threat model .","title":"F-Droid"},{"location":"android/#neo-store","text":"The official F-Droid client targets a low API level and does not utilize the seamless updates feature introduced in Android 12. Targeting lower API levels means that the F-Droid client cannot take advantage of the new improvements in the application sandboxes that comes with higher API levels. For automatic updates to work, the F-Droid client requires that the Privileged Extension be included in the operating system, granting it more privileges than what a normal app would have, which is not great for security. To mitigate these problems, we recommend Neo Store as it supports seamless updates on Android 12 and above without needing any special privileges and targets a higher API level. Recommendation Neo Store is a modern F-Droid client made with MaterialUI, forked from Foxy Droid . Unlike the official F-Droid client, Neo Store supports seamless updates on Android 12 and above without the need for a privileged extension.

In general, we recommend keeping extensions to a minimum: they have privileged access within your browser, require you to trust the developer, can make you stand out , and weaken site isolation. General Recommendations \u00b6 Tor Browser \u00b6 Recommendation Tor Browser is the choice if you need anonymity. This browser provides you with access to the Tor Bridges and Tor Network , along with extensions that can be automatically configured to fit its three security levels: Standard , Safer and Safest . We recommend that you do not change any of Tor Browser's default configurations outside of the standard security levels. Homepage tor Privacy Policy Downloads Windows macOS Linux flathub Flatpak Google Play f-droid F-Droid Source Danger You should never install any additional extensions on Tor Browser, including the ones we suggest for Firefox. Browser extensions make you stand out from others on the Tor network, thus making your browser easier to fingerprint . Desktop Recommendations \u00b6 Firefox \u00b6 Recommendation Firefox provides strong privacy settings such as Enhanced Tracking Protection , which can help block various types of tracking . Homepage Privacy Policy Downloads Windows macOS Linux flathub Flatpak Source Warning Firefox includes a unique download token in downloads from Mozilla's website and uses telemetry in Firefox to send the token. The token is not included in releases from the Mozilla FTP . Recommended Configuration \u00b6 Tor Browser is the only way to truly browse the internet anonymously. When you use Firefox we recommend changing the following settings to protect your privacy from certain parties, but all browsers other than Tor Browser will be traceable by somebody in some regard or another. These options can be found in \u2192 Settings \u2192 Privacy & Security . Enhanced Tracking Protection \u00b6 Select Strict Enhanced Tracking Protection This protects you by blocking social media trackers, fingerprinting scripts (note that this does not protect you from all fingerprinting), cryptominers, cross-site tracking cookies, and some other tracking content. ETP protects against many common threats, but it does not block all tracking avenues because it is designed to have minimal to no impact on site usability. Sanitize on Close \u00b6 If you want to stay logged in to particular sites, you can allow exceptions in Cookies and Site Data \u2192 Manage Exceptions... Check Delete cookies and site data when Firefox is closed This protects you from persistent cookies, but does not protect you against cookies acquired during any one browsing session. When this is enabled, it becomes possible to easily cleanse your browser cookies by simply restarting Firefox. You can set exceptions on a per-site basis, if you wish to stay logged in to a particular site you visit often. Search Suggestions \u00b6 Disable Suggestions from the web Disable Suggestions from sponsors Disable Improve the Firefox Suggest experience Search suggestion features may not be available in your region. Search suggestions send everything you type in the address bar to the default search engine, regardless of whether you submit an actual search. Disabling search suggestions allows you to more precisely control what data you send to your search engine provider. Telemetry \u00b6 Uncheck Allow Firefox to send technical and interaction data to Mozilla Uncheck Allow Firefox to install and run studies Uncheck Allow Firefox to send backlogged crash reports on your behalf Firefox sends data about your Firefox version and language; device operating system and hardware configuration; memory, basic information about crashes and errors; outcome of automated processes like updates, safebrowsing, and activation to us. When Firefox sends data to us, your IP address is temporarily collected as part of our server logs. HTTPS -Only Mode \u00b6 Select Enable HTTPS -Only Mode in all windows This prevents you from unintentionally connecting to a website in plain-text HTTP . Sites without HTTPS are uncommon nowadays, so this should have little to no impact on your day to day browsing. Sync \u00b6 Firefox Sync allows your browsing data (history, bookmarks, etc.) to be accessible on all your devices and protects it with E2EE . Arkenfox (advanced) \u00b6 The Arkenfox project provides a set of carefully considered options for Firefox. If you decide to use Arkenfox, a few options are subjectively strict and/or may cause some websites to not work properly - which you can easily change to suit your needs. We strongly recommend reading through their full wiki . Arkenfox also enables container support. Brave \u00b6 Recommendation Brave Browser includes a built in content blocker and privacy features , many of which are enabled by default. Brave is built upon the Chromium web browser project, so it should feel familiar and have minimal website compatibility issues. We don't recommend Brave's mobile browser offerings as there are better options for mobile platforms. Homepage Privacy Policy Downloads Windows macOS Linux (1) Source We advise against using the Flatpak version of Brave as it is believed to feature a weaker sandboxing system. As well, the package is not maintained by Brave Software, Inc. Recommended Configuration \u00b6 Tor Browser is the only way to truly browse the internet anonymously. When you use Brave we recommend changing the following settings to protect your privacy from certain parties, but all browsers other than the Tor Browser will be traceable by somebody in some regard or another. These options can be found in \u2192 Settings . Shields \u00b6 Brave includes some anti-fingerprinting measures in its Shields feature. We suggest configuring these options globally across all pages that you visit. Shields' options can be downgraded on a per-site basis as needed, but by default we recommend setting the following: Select Aggressive under Trackers & ads blocking Use default filter lists Brave allows you to select additional content filters within the internal brave://adblock page. We advise against using this feature; instead, keep the default filter lists. Using extra lists will make you stand out from other Brave users and may also increase attack surface if there is an exploit in Brave and a malicious rule is added to one of the lists you use. (Optional) Select Block Scripts (1) Select Strict, may break sites under Block fingerprinting This option provides functionality similar to uBlock Origin's advanced blocking modes or the NoScript extension. Social media blocking \u00b6 Uncheck all social media components Privacy and Security \u00b6 Select Disable Non-Proxied UDP under WebRTC IP Handling Policy Uncheck Use Google services for push messaging Uncheck Allow privacy-preserving product analytics (P3A) Uncheck Automatically send daily usage ping to Brave Select Always use secure connections in the Security menu Sanitizing on Close Select Clear cookies and site data when you close all windows in the Cookies and other site data menu If you wish to stay logged in to a particular site you visit often, you can set exceptions on a per-site basis under the Customized behaviors section. Extensions \u00b6 Disable built-in extensions you do not use in Extensions Uncheck Hangouts Uncheck Private window with Tor (1) Uncheck WebTorrent Brave is not as resistant to fingerprinting as the Tor Browser and far fewer people use Brave with Tor, so you will stand out. Where strong anonymity is required use the Tor Browser . IPFS \u00b6 InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is a decentralized, peer-to-peer network for storing and sharing data in a distributed filesystem. Unless you use the feature, disable it. Select Disabled on Method to resolve IPFS resources Additional settings \u00b6 Under the system System menu Uncheck Continue running apps when Brave is closed to disable background apps (1) This option is not present on all platforms. Mobile Recommendations \u00b6 On Android, Firefox is still less secure than Chromium-based alternatives: Mozilla's engine, GeckoView , has yet to support site isolation or enable isolatedProcess . On iOS, any app that can browse the web is restricted to using an Apple-provided WebKit framework , so there is little reason to use a third-party web browser. Bromite \u00b6 Recommendation Bromite is a Chromium-based browser with privacy and security enhancements, built-in ad blocking, and some fingerprinting randomization. Homepage Privacy Policy Downloads f-droid F-Droid (1) Source Neo Store users can enable the Bromite repository in \u2192 Repositories These options can be found in \u2192 Settings \u2192 Privacy and Security . Recommended Configuration \u00b6 HTTPS -Only Mode \u00b6 Select Always use secure connections This prevents you from unintentionally connecting to a website in plain-text HTTP . The HTTP protocol is extremely uncommon nowadays, so this should have little to no impact on your day to day browsing. Always-on Incognito Mode \u00b6 Select Open links in incognito tabs always Select Close all open tabs on exit Select Open external links in incognito Safari \u00b6 Recommendation Safari is the default browser in iOS. It includes privacy features such as Intelligent Tracking Protection, Privacy Report, isolated Private Browsing tabs, iCloud Private Relay, and automatic HTTPS upgrades. Website Privacy Policy Recommended Configuration \u00b6 These options can be found in Settings \u2192 Safari \u2192 Privacy and Security . Cross-Site Tracking Prevention \u00b6 Enable Prevent Cross-Site Tracking This enables WebKit's Intelligent Tracking Protection . The feature helps protect against unwanted tracking by using on-device machine learning to stop trackers. ITP protects against many common threats, but it does not block all tracking avenues because it is designed to not interfere with website usability. Privacy Report \u00b6 Privacy Report provides a snapshot of cross-site trackers currently prevented from profiling you on the website you're visiting. It can also display a weekly report to show which trackers have been blocked over time. Privacy Report is accessible via the Page Settings menu ( ). Privacy Preserving Ad Measurement \u00b6 Disable Privacy Preserving Ad Measurement Ad click measurement has traditionally used tracking technology that infringes on user privacy. Private Click Measurement is a WebKit feature and proposed web standard aimed towards allowing advertisers to measure the effectiveness of web campaigns without compromising on user privacy. The feature has little privacy concerns on its own, so while you can choose to leave it on, we consider the fact that it's automatically disabled in Private Browsing to be an indicator for disabling the feature. Apple Pay \u00b6 If you do not use Apple Pay, you can toggle off the ability for websites to check for it. Disable Allow websites to check for Apple Pay and Apple Card Always-on Private Browsing \u00b6 Open Safari and tap the Tabs button, located in the bottom right. Then, expand the Tab Groups list. Select Private Safari's Private Browsing mode offers additional privacy protections. Private Browsing uses a new ephemeral session for each tab, meaning tabs are isolated from one another. There are also other smaller privacy benefits with Private Browsing, such as not sending a webpage\u2019s address to Apple when using Safari's translation feature. Do note that Private Browsing does not save cookies and website data, so it won't be possible to remain signed into sites. This may be an inconvenience. iCloud Sync \u00b6 Synchronization of Safari History, Tab Groups, iCloud Tabs, and saved passwords are E2EE . However, bookmarks are not . Apple can decrypt and access them in accordance with their privacy policy . If you use iCloud, we also recommend checking to ensure Safari's default download location is set to locally on your device. This option can be found in Settings \u2192 Safari \u2192 General \u2192 Downloads . Additional Resources \u00b6 We generally do not recommend installing any extensions as they increase your attack surface . However, uBlock Origin or AdGuard may prove useful if you value content blocking functionality. uBlock Origin \u00b6 Recommendation uBlock Origin is a popular content blocker that could help you block ads, trackers, and fingerprinting scripts. Extension Info Downloads Firefox Chrome Edge Opera Source We suggest leaving the extension in its default configuration. Additional filter lists can impact performance and may increase attack surface , so only apply what you need. If there is a vulnerability in uBlock Origin a third party filter could add malicious rules that can potentially steal user data. uBlock Origin is also a Mozilla Recommended Extension . Recommended extensions are manually reviewed by Mozilla staff security experts to ensure they meet the highest standards of security, functionality, and user experience. AdGuard for Safari \u00b6 Recommendation AdGuard for Safari is a free and open-source content-blocking extension for Safari that uses the native Content Blocker API . We suggest enabling the filters labled #recommended under the \"Ad Blocking\" and \"Privacy\" content blockers . The #recommended filters can also be enabled for the \"Social Widgets\" and \"Annoyances\" content blockers, but they may break some social media functions. Website Privacy Policy Downloads Safari App Store Source Additional filter lists do slow things down and may increase your attack surface , so only apply what you need. There is also AdGuard for iOS which is able to perform system-wide content blocking by means of DNS filtering. Snowflake \u00b6 Recommendation Snowflake allows you to donate bandwidth to the Tor Project by operating a \"Snowflake proxy\" within your browser. People who are censored can use Snowflake proxies to connect to the Tor network. Snowflake is a great way to contribute to the network even if you don't have the technical know-how to run a Tor relay or bridge. Website Downloads Browser (Leave page open to continue being a Snowflake proxy) Firefox Chrome Snowflake does not increase your privacy in any way, nor is it used to connect to the Tor network within your personal browser. However, if your internet connection is uncensored, you should consider running it to help people in censored networks achieve better privacy themselves. There is no need to worry about which websites people are accessing through your proxy\u2014their visible browsing IP address will match their Tor exit node, not yours. Running a Snowflake proxy is low-risk, even moreso than running a Tor relay or bridge which are already not particularly risky endeavours. However, it does still proxy traffic through your network which can be impactful in some ways, especially if your network is bandwidth-limited. Make sure you understand how Snowflake works before deciding whether to run a proxy. You can enable Snowflake in your browser by clicking the switch below and leaving this page open .

How do I protect my private keys? Recommended Email Providers \u00b6 ProtonMail \u00b6 Recommendation ProtonMail is an email service with a focus on privacy, encryption, security, and ease of use. They have been in operation since 2013 . ProtonMail is based in Gen\u00e8ve, Switzerland. Accounts start with 500 MB storage with their free plan. Free accounts have some limitations, such as not being able to search body text and not having access to ProtonMail Bridge , which is required to use a recommended desktop email client (e.g. Thunderbird). Paid accounts are available starting at \u20ac48/y which include features like ProtonMail Bridge, additional storage, and custom domain support. Free Website Privacy Policy Custom Domains and Aliases Paid ProtonMail subscribers can use their own domain with the service. Catch-all addresses are supported with custom domains for Professional and Visionary plans. ProtonMail also supports subaddressing , which is useful for people who don't want to purchase a domain. Private Payment Methods ProtonMail accepts Bitcoin in addition to accepting credit/debit cards and PayPal. Account Security ProtonMail supports TOTP two factor authentication only. The use of a U2F security key is not yet supported. ProtonMail is planning to implement U2F upon completion of their Single Sign On (SSO) code. Data Security ProtonMail has zero access encryption at rest for your emails, address book contacts , and calendars . This means the messages and other data stored in your account are only readable by you. Email Encryption ProtonMail has integrated OpenPGP encryption in their webmail. Emails to other ProtonMail accounts are encrypted automatically, and encryption to non-ProtonMail addresses with an OpenPGP key can be enabled easily in your account settings. They also allow you to encrypt messages to non-ProtonMail addresses without the need for them to sign up for a ProtonMail account or use software like OpenPGP . ProtonMail also supports the discovery of public keys via HTTP from their Web Key Directory (WKD) . This allows people who don't use ProtonMail to find the OpenPGP keys of ProtonMail accounts easily, for cross-provider E2EE . Additional Functionality ProtonMail's login and services are accessible over Tor, protonmailrmez3lotccipshtkleegetolb73fuirgj7r4o4vfu7ozyd.onion ProtonMail offers a \"Visionary\" account for \u20ac24/Month, which also enables access to ProtonVPN in addition to providing multiple accounts, domains, aliases, and extra storage. Mailbox.org \u00b6 Recommendation Mailbox.org is an email service with a focus on being secure, ad-free, and privately powered by 100% eco-friendly energy. They have been in operation since 2014. Mailbox.org is based in Berlin, Germany. Accounts start with 2 GB of storage, which can be upgraded as needed. EUR \u20ac12/year Website Privacy Policy Custom Domains and Aliases Mailbox.org lets you use your own domain, and they support catch-all addresses. Mailbox.org also supports subaddressing , which is useful if you don't want to purchase a domain. Private Payment Methods Mailbox.org doesn't accept Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrencies as a result of their payment processor BitPay suspending operations in Germany. However, they do accept Cash by mail, cash payment to bank account, bank transfer, credit card, PayPal and couple of German-specific processors: paydirekt and Sofort\u00fcberweisung. Account Security Mailbox.org supports two factor authentication for their webmail only. You can use either TOTP or a Yubikey via the Yubicloud . Web standards such as WebAuthn are not yet supported. Data Security Mailbox.org allows for encryption of incoming mail using their encrypted mailbox . New messages that you receive will then be immediately encrypted with your public key. However, Open-Exchange , the software platform used by Mailbox.org, does not support the encryption of your address book and calendar. A standalone option may be more appropriate for that information. Email Encryption Mailbox.org has integrated encryption in their webmail, which simplifies sending messages to people with public OpenPGP keys. They also allow remote recipients to decrypt an email on Mailbox.org's servers. This feature is useful when the remote recipient does not have OpenPGP and cannot decrypt a copy of the email in their own mailbox. Mailbox.org also supports the discovery of public keys via HTTP from their Web Key Directory (WKD) . This allows people outside of Mailbox.org to find the OpenPGP keys of Mailbox.org accounts easily, for cross-provider E2EE . Additional Functionality You can access your Mailbox.org account via IMAP / SMTP using their .onion service . However, their webmail interface cannot be accessed via their .onion service, and you may experience TLS certificate errors. All accounts come with limited cloud storage that can be encrypted . Mailbox.org also offers the alias @secure.mailbox.org , which enforces the TLS encryption on the connection between mail servers, otherwise the message will not be sent at all. Mailbox.org also supports Exchange ActiveSync in addition to standard access protocols like IMAP and POP3. Tutanota \u00b6 Recommendation Tutanota.com is an email service with a focus on security and privacy through the use of encryption. Tutanota has been in operation since 2011 and is based in Hanover, Germany. Accounts start with 1GB storage with their free plan. Free Website Privacy Policy Tutanota doesn't allow the use of third-party email clients . Tutanota has no plans pull email from external email accounts using the IMAP protocol. Email import is currently not possible. Emails can be exported individually or by bulk selection . Tutanota does not allow for subfolders as you might expect with other email providers. Tutanota is working on a desktop client and they have an app available in F-Droid . They also have their app in conventional stores such as App Store on iOS and Google Play for Android. Custom Domains and Aliases Paid Tutanota accounts can use up to 5 aliases and custom domains . Tutanota doesn't allow for subaddressing (plus addresses) , but you can use a catch-all with a custom domain. Private Payment Methods Tutanota only directly accepts credit cards and PayPal, however Bitcoin and Monero can be used to purchase gift cards via their partnership with Proxystore. Account Security Tutanota supports two factor authentication with either TOTP or U2F . U2F support is not yet available on Android . Data Security Tutanota has zero access encryption at rest for your emails, address book contacts , and calendars . This means the messages and other data stored in your account are only readable by you. Email Encryption Tutanota does not use OpenPGP . Tutanota accounts can only receive encrypted emails from non-Tutanota email accounts when sent via a temporary Tutanota mailbox . Tutanota does have plans to support AutoCrypt . This would allow for non-Tutanota emails to send encrypted emails to Tutanota accounts as long as their email client supports the AutoCrypt headers.

Private Payment Methods StartMail accepts Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Paypal. StartMail also has other payment options such as Bitcoin (currently only for Personal accounts) and SEPA Direct Debit for accounts older than a year. Account Security StartMail supports TOTP two factor authentication for webmail only . They do not allow U2F security key authentication. Data Security StartMail has zero access encryption at rest , using their \"user vault\" system. When you log in, the vault is opened, and the email is then moved to the vault out of the queue where it is decrypted by the corresponding private key. StartMail supports importing contacts however, they are only accessible in the webmail and not through protocols such as CalDAV . Contacts are also not stored using zero knowledge encryption, so a standalone option may be more appropriate. Email Encryption StartMail has integrated encryption in their webmail, which simplifies sending encrypted messages with public OpenPGP keys. Additional Functionality StartMail allows for proxying of images within emails. If you allow the remote image to be loaded, the sender won't know what your IP address is. Email Aliasing Services \u00b6 An email aliasing service allows you to easily generate a new email address for every website you register for. The email aliases you generate are then forwarded to an email address of your choosing, hiding both your \"main\" email address and the identity of your email provider. True email aliasing is better than plus addressing commonly used and supported by many providers, which allows you to create aliases like yourname+[anythinghere]@example.com, because websites, advertisers, and tracking networks can trivially remove anything after the + sign to know your true email address. Email aliasing can act as a safeguard in case your email provider ever ceases operation. In that scenario, you can easily re-route your aliases to a new email address. In turn, however, you are placing trust in the aliasing service to continue functioning. Using a dedicated email aliasing service also has a number of benefits over a catch-all alias on a custom domain: Aliases can be turned on and off individually when you need them, preventing websites from emailing you randomly. Replies are sent from the alias address, shielding your real email address. They also have a number of benefits over \"temporary email\" services: Aliases are permanent, and can be turned on again if you need to receive something like a password reset. Emails are sent to your trusted mailbox rather than stored by the alias provider. Temporary email services typically have public mailboxes which can be accessed by anyone who knows the address, aliases are private to you. Our email aliasing recommendations are providers that allow you to create aliases on domains they control, as well as your own custom domain(s) for a modest yearly fee. They can also be self-hosted if you want maximum control. However, using a custom domain can have privacy-related drawbacks: If you are the only person using your custom domain, your actions can be easily tracked across websites simply by looking at the domain name in the email address and ignoring everything before the at (@) sign. Using an aliasing service requires trusting both your email provider and your aliasing provider with your unencrypted messages. Some providers mitigate this slightly with automatic PGP encryption, which reduces the number of parties you need to trust from 2 to 1 by encrypting incoming emails before they are delivered to your final mailbox provider.

This allows us to provide completely objective recommendations. We have developed a clear set of requirements for any Email provider wishing to be recommended, including implementing industry best practices, modern technology and more. We suggest you familiarize yourself with this list before choosing an Email provider, and conduct your own research to ensure the Email provider you choose is the right choice for you. Jurisdiction \u00b6 Operating outside the five/nine/fourteen-eyes countries is not necessarily a guarantee of privacy, and there are other factors to consider. Minimum to Qualify: Operating outside the USA or other Five Eyes countries. Best Case: Operating outside the USA or other Fourteen Eyes countries. Operating inside a country with strong consumer protection laws. Technology \u00b6 We regard these features as important in order to provide a safe and optimal service. You should consider whether the provider which has the features you require. Minimum to Qualify: Encrypts email account data at rest with zero-access encryption. Integrated webmail E2EE / PGP encryption provided as a convenience. Best Case: Encrypts all account data (Contacts, Calendars etc) at rest with zero-access encryption. Allow users to use their own domain name . Custom domain names are important to users because it allows them to maintain their agency from the service, should it turn bad or be acquired by another company which doesn't prioritize privacy etc. Support for WKD to allow improved discovery of public OpenPGP keys via HTTP . GnuPG users can get a key by typing: gpg --locate-key example_user@example.com Support for a temporary mailbox for external users. This is useful when you want to send an encrypted email, without sending an actual copy to your recipient. These emails usually have a limited lifespan and then are automatically deleted. They also don't require the recipient to configure any cryptography like OpenPGP . Availability of the email provider's services via an onion service . Subaddressing support. Catch-all or alias functionality for those who own their own domains. Use of standard email access protocols such as IMAP , SMTP or JMAP . Standard access protocols ensure customers can easily download all of their email, should they want to switch to another provider. Privacy \u00b6 We prefer our recommended providers to collect as little data as possible. Minimum to Qualify: Protect sender's IP address. Filter it from showing in the Received header field. Don't require personally identifiable information ( PII ) besides username and password. Privacy policy that meets the requirements defined by the GDPR Best Case: Accepts Bitcoin, cash, and other forms of cryptocurrency and/or anonymous payment options (gift cards, etc.) Security \u00b6 Email servers deal with a lot of very sensitive data. We expect that providers will adopt best industry practices in order to protect their members. Minimum to Qualify: Protection of webmail with 2FA , such as TOTP . Encryption at rest, (e.g. dm-crypt ) this protects the contents of the servers in case of unlawful seizure. DNSSEC support. No TLS errors/vulnerabilities when being profiled by tools such as Hardenize , testssl.sh or Qualys SSL Labs , this includes certificate related errors, poor or weak ciphers suites, weak DH parameters such as those that led to Logjam . A valid MTA-STS and TLS -RPT policy. Valid DANE records. Valid SPF and DKIM records. Have a proper DMARC record and policy or utilize ARC for authentication. If DMARC authentication is being used, the policy must be set to reject or quarantine . A server suite preference of TLS 1.2 or later and a plan for Deprecating TLSv1.0 and TLSv1.1 . SMTPS submission, assuming SMTP is used. Website security standards such as: HTTP Strict Transport Security Subresource Integrity if loading things from external domains. Best Case: Support for hardware authentication, ie U2F and WebAuthn . U2F and WebAuthn are more secure as they use a private key stored on a client-side hardware device to authenticate people, as opposed to a shared secret that is stored on the web server and on the client side when using TOTP . Furthermore, U2F and WebAuthn are more resistant to phishing as their authentication response is based on the authenticated domain name . Zero access encryption, builds on encryption at rest. The difference being the provider does not have the decryption keys to the data they hold. This prevents a rogue employee leaking data they have access to or remote adversary from releasing data they have stolen by gaining unauthorized access to the server. DNS Certification Authority Authorization (CAA) Resource Record in addition to DANE support. Implementation of Authenticated Received Chain (ARC) , this is useful for people who post to mailing lists RFC8617 . Bug-bounty programs and/or a coordinated vulnerability-disclosure process. Website security standards such as: Content Security Policy (CSP) Expect-CT Trust \u00b6 You wouldn't trust your finances to someone with a fake identity, so why trust them with your email? We require our recommended providers to be public about their ownership or leadership. We also would like to see frequent transparency reports, especially in regard to how government requests are handled. Minimum to Qualify: Public-facing leadership or ownership. Best Case: Public-facing leadership. Frequent transparency reports. Marketing \u00b6 With the email providers we recommend we like to see responsible marketing. Minimum to Qualify: Must self host analytics (no Google Analytics etc). The provider's site must also comply with DNT (Do Not Track) for those who wish to opt-out. Must not have any marketing which is irresponsible: Claims of \"unbreakable encryption\". Encryption should be used with the intention that it may not be secret in the future when the technology exists to crack it. Making guarantees of protecting anonymity 100%. When someone makes a claim that something is 100% it means there is no certainty for failure. We know people can quite easily deanonymize themselves in a number of ways, e.g.: Reusing personal information e.g. (email accounts, unique pseudonyms etc) that they accessed without anonymity software (Tor, VPN etc) Browser fingerprinting Best Case: Clear and easy to read documentation. This includes things like, setting up 2FA , email clients, OpenPGP , etc. Additional Functionality \u00b6 While not strictly requirements, there are some other convenience or privacy factors we looked into when determining which providers to recommend. Email Encryption Overview \u00b6 What is end-to-end encryption ( E2EE ) in email? \u00b6 E2EE is a way of encrypting email contents so that nobody but the recipient(s) can read the email message. How can I encrypt my email? \u00b6 The standard way to do email E2EE and have it work between different email providers is with OpenPGP . There are different implementations of the OpenPGP standard, the most common being GnuPG and OpenPGP .js . There is another standard that was popular with business called S/MIME , however it requires a certificate issued from a Certificate Authority (not all of them issue S/MIME certificates). It has support in Google Workplace and Outlook for Web or Exchange Server 2016, 2019 . What software can I use to get E2EE ? \u00b6 Email providers which allow you to use standard access protocols like IMAP and SMTP can be used with any of the email clients we recommend . This can be less secure as you are now relying on email providers to ensure that their encryption implementation works and has not been compromised in anyway. How do I protect my private keys? \u00b6 A smartcard (such as a Yubikey or Nitrokey ) works by receiving an encrypted email message from a device (phone, tablet, computer etc) running an email/webmail client. The message is then decrypted by the smartcard and the decrypted content is sent back to the device. It is advantageous for the decryption to occur on the smartcard so as to avoid possibly exposing your private key to a compromised device. Email Metadata Overview \u00b6 Who can see the email metadata? \u00b6 Email metadata is able to be seen by your email client software (or webmail) and any servers relaying the message from you to any recipients. Sometimes email servers will also use external parties to protect against spam. What is email metadata? \u00b6 Email software will often show some visible headers that you may have seen such as: To , From , Cc , Date , Subject . When is email metadata used? \u00b6 Client software may use it to show who a message is from and what time it was received. Servers may use it to determine where an email message must be sent, among other purposes which are not always transparent. Where is the email metadata? \u00b6 Email metadata is stored in the message header of the email message. Why can't email metadata be E2EE ? \u00b6 Email metadata is crucial to the most basic functionality of email (where it came from, and where it has to go). E2EE was not built into the email protocols originally and is also optional, therefore, only the message content is protected. How is my metadata protected? \u00b6 When emails travel between email providers an encrypted connection is negotiated using Opportunistic TLS . This protects the metadata from outside observers, but as it is not E2EE , server administrators can snoop on the metadata of an email.

General Linux Overview If you don't already use Linux, below are some distributions we suggest trying out, as well as some general privacy and security improvement tips that are applicable to many Linux distributions. Traditional Distributions \u00b6 Fedora Workstation \u00b6 Recommendation Fedora Workstation is our recommended distribution for people new to Linux. Fedora generally adopts newer technologies before other distributions e.g., Wayland , PipeWire , and soon, FS-Verity . These new technologies often come with improvements in security, privacy, and usability in general. Homepage Fedora has a semi- rolling release cycle. While some packages like GNOME are frozen until the next Fedora release, most packages (including the kernel) are updated frequently throughout the lifespan of the release. Each Fedora release is supported for one year, with a new version released every 6 months. openSUSE Tumbleweed \u00b6 Recommendation openSUSE Tumbleweed is a stable rolling release distribution. openSUSE Tumbleweed has a transactional update system that uses Btrfs and Snapper to ensure that snapshots can be rolled back should there be a problem. Homepage Tumbleweed follows a rolling release model where each update is released as a snapshot of the distribution. When you upgrade your system, a new snapshot is downloaded. Each snapshot is run through a series of automated tests by openQA to ensure its quality. Arch Linux \u00b6 Recommendation Arch Linux is a lightweight, do-it-yourself (DIY) distribution meaning that you only get what you install. For more information see their FAQ . Homepage Arch Linux has a rolling release cycle. There is no fixed release schedule and packages are updated very frequently. Being a DIY distribution, you are expected to set up and maintain your system on your own. Arch has an official installer to make the installation process a little easier. A large portion of Arch Linux\u2019s packages are reproducible . Immutable Distributions \u00b6 Fedora Silverblue \u00b6 Recommendation Fedora Silverblue and Fedora Kinoite are immutable variants of Fedora with a strong focus on container workflows. Silverblue comes with the GNOME desktop environment while Kinoite comes with KDE . Silverblue and Kinoite follow the same release schedule as Fedora Workstation, benefiting from the same fast updates and staying very close to upstream. Homepage Silverblue (and Kinoite) differ from Fedora Workstation as they replace the DNF package manager with a much more advanced alternative called rpm-ostree . The rpm-ostree package manager works by downloading a base image for the system, then overlaying packages over it in a git -like commit tree. When the system is updated, a new base image is downloaded and the overlays will be applied to that new image. After the update is complete you will reboot the system into the new deployment. rpm-ostree keeps two deployments of the system so that you can easily rollback if something breaks in the new deployment. There is also the option to pin more deployments as needed. Flatpak is the primary package installation method on these distributions, as rpm-ostree is only meant to overlay packages that cannot stay inside of a container on top of the base image. As an alternative to Flatpaks, there is the option of Toolbox to create Podman containers with a shared home directory with the host operating system and mimic a traditional Fedora environment, which is a useful feature for the discerning developer. NixOS \u00b6 Recommendation NixOS is an independent distribution based on the Nix package manager with a focus on reproducibility and reliability. Homepage NixOS\u2019s package manager keeps every version of every package in a different folder in the Nix store . Due to this you can have different versions of the same package installed on your system. After the package contents have been written to the folder, the folder is made read-only. NixOS also provides atomic updates; first it downloads (or builds) the packages and files for the new system generation and then switches to it. There are different ways to switch to a new generation; you can tell NixOS to activate it after reboot or you can switch to it at runtime. You can also test the new generation by switching to it at runtime, but not setting it as the current system generation. If something in the update process breaks, you can just reboot and automatically and return to a working version of your system. Nix the package manager uses a purely functional language - which is also called Nix - to define packages. Nixpkgs (the main source of packages) are contained in a single GitHub repository. You can also define your own packages in the same language and then easily include them in your config. Nix is a source-based package manager; if there\u2019s no pre-built available in the binary cache, Nix will just build the package from source using its definition. It builds each package in a sandboxed pure environment, which is as independent of the host system as possible, thus making binaries reproducible. Anonymity-Focused Distributions \u00b6 Whonix \u00b6 Recommendation Whonix is based on Kicksecure , a security-focused fork of Debian. It aims to provide privacy, security, and anonymity on the internet. Homepage Whonix is meant to run as two virtual machines: a \u201cWorkstation\u201d and a Tor \u201cGateway\u201d. All communications from the Workstation has to go through the Tor gateway, and will be routed through the Tor Network. Some of its features include Tor Stream Isolation, keystroke anonymization , encrypted swap , and a hardened memory allocator. Future versions of Whonix will likely include full system AppArmor policies and a sandbox app launcher to fully confine all processes on the system. Whonix is best used in conjunction with Qubes . Tails \u00b6 Recommendation Tails is a live operating system based on Debian that routes all communications through Tor. It can boot on almost any computer from a DVD, USB stick, or SD card. It aims to preserve privacy and anonymity while circumventing censorship and leaving no trace of itself on the computer it is used on. Homepage By design, Tails is meant to completely reset itself after each reboot. Encrypted persistent storage can be configured to store some data. General Recommendations \u00b6 Drive Encryption \u00b6 Most Linux distributions have an installer option for enabling LUKS FDE upon installation. If this option isn\u2019t set at installation time, you will have to backup your data and re-install, as encryption is applied after disk partitioning , but before file systems are formatted. When securely erasing storage devices such as a Solid-state drive (SSD) you should use the ATA Secure Erase command. This command can be issued from your UEFI setup. If the storage device is a regular hard drive (HDD), consider using nwipe . Swap \u00b6 Consider using ZRAM or encrypted swap instead of unencrypted swap to avoid potential security issues with sensitive data being pushed to swap space . Fedora based distributions use ZRAM by default . Wayland \u00b6 We recommend using a desktop environment that supports the Wayland display protocol as it developed with security in mind . Its predecessor, X11 , does not support GUI isolation, allowing all windows to record screen, log and inject inputs in other windows , making any attempt at sandboxing futile. While there are options to do nested X11 such as Xpra or Xephyr , they often come with negative performance consequences and are not convenient to set up and are not preferable over Wayland. Fortunately, common environments such as GNOME , KDE , and the window manager Sway have support for Wayland. Some distributions like Fedora and Tumbleweed use it by default and some others may do so in the future as X11 is in hard maintenance mode . If you\u2019re using one of those environments it is as easy as selecting the \u201cWayland\u201d session at the desktop display manager ( GDM , SDDM ). We recommend against using desktop environments or window managers that do not have Wayland support such as Cinnamon (default on Linux Mint), Pantheon (default on Elementary OS ), MATE, Xfce, and i3. Proprietary Firmware (Microcode Updates) \u00b6 Linux distributions such as those which are Linux-libre or DIY (Arch Linux) don\u2019t come with the proprietary microcode updates. Some notable examples of these vulnerabilities include Spectre , Meltdown , SSB , Foreshadow , MDS , SWAPGS , and other hardware vulnerabilities . We highly recommend that you install the microcode updates, as your CPU is already running the proprietary microcode from the factory. Fedora and openSUSE both have the microcode updates applied by default. Privacy Tweaks \u00b6 MAC Address Randomization \u00b6 Many desktop Linux distributions (Fedora, openSUSE etc) will come with NetworkManager , to configure Ethernet and Wi-Fi settings. It is possible to randomize the MAC address when using NetworkManager. This provides a bit more privacy on Wi-Fi networks as it makes it harder to track specific devices on the network you\u2019re connected to. It does not make you anonymous. We recommend changing the setting to random instead of stable , as suggested in the article . If you are using systemd-networkd , you will need to set MACAddressPolicy=random which will enable RFC 7844 (Anonymity Profiles for DHCP Clients) . There isn\u2019t much point in randomizing the MAC address for Ethernet connections as a system administrator can find you by looking at the port you are using on the network switch . Randomizing Wi-Fi MAC addresses depends on support from the Wi-Fi\u2019s firmware. Other Identifiers \u00b6 There are other system identifiers which you may wish to be careful about. You should give this some thought to see if it applies to your threat model : Hostnames: Your system's hostname is shared with the networks you connect to. You should avoid including identifying terms like your name or operating system in your hostname, instead sticking to generic terms or random strings. Usernames: Similarly, your username is used in a variety of ways across your system. Consider using generic terms like \"user\" rather than your actual name. Machine ID: : During installation a unique machine ID is generated and stored on your device. Consider setting it to a generic ID . System Counting \u00b6 The Fedora Project counts how many unique systems access its mirrors by using a countme variable instead of a unique ID. Fedora does this to determine load and provision better servers for updates where necessary. This option is currently off by default. We recommend adding countme=false to /etc/dnf/dnf.conf just in case it is enabled in the future. On systems that use rpm-ostree such as Silverblue, the countme option is disabled by masking the rpm-ostree-countme timer. openSUSE also uses a unique ID to count systems, which can be disabled by deleting the /var/lib/zypp/AnonymousUniqueId file.","title":"Linux"},{"location":"linux-desktop/#traditional-distributions","text":"","title":"Traditional Distributions"},{"location":"linux-desktop/#fedora-workstation","text":"Recommendation Fedora Workstation is our recommended distribution for people new to Linux.

Silverblue comes with the GNOME desktop environment while Kinoite comes with KDE . Silverblue and Kinoite follow the same release schedule as Fedora Workstation, benefiting from the same fast updates and staying very close to upstream. Homepage Silverblue (and Kinoite) differ from Fedora Workstation as they replace the DNF package manager with a much more advanced alternative called rpm-ostree . The rpm-ostree package manager works by downloading a base image for the system, then overlaying packages over it in a git -like commit tree. When the system is updated, a new base image is downloaded and the overlays will be applied to that new image. After the update is complete you will reboot the system into the new deployment. rpm-ostree keeps two deployments of the system so that you can easily rollback if something breaks in the new deployment. There is also the option to pin more deployments as needed. Flatpak is the primary package installation method on these distributions, as rpm-ostree is only meant to overlay packages that cannot stay inside of a container on top of the base image. As an alternative to Flatpaks, there is the option of Toolbox to create Podman containers with a shared home directory with the host operating system and mimic a traditional Fedora environment, which is a useful feature for the discerning developer.","title":"Fedora Silverblue"},{"location":"linux-desktop/#nixos","text":"Recommendation NixOS is an independent distribution based on the Nix package manager with a focus on reproducibility and reliability. Homepage NixOS\u2019s package manager keeps every version of every package in a different folder in the Nix store . Due to this you can have different versions of the same package installed on your system. After the package contents have been written to the folder, the folder is made read-only. NixOS also provides atomic updates; first it downloads (or builds) the packages and files for the new system generation and then switches to it. There are different ways to switch to a new generation; you can tell NixOS to activate it after reboot or you can switch to it at runtime. You can also test the new generation by switching to it at runtime, but not setting it as the current system generation. If something in the update process breaks, you can just reboot and automatically and return to a working version of your system. Nix the package manager uses a purely functional language - which is also called Nix - to define packages. Nixpkgs (the main source of packages) are contained in a single GitHub repository. You can also define your own packages in the same language and then easily include them in your config. Nix is a source-based package manager; if there\u2019s no pre-built available in the binary cache, Nix will just build the package from source using its definition.

Some YubiKey models have a wide range of features such as: Universal 2nd Factor ( U2F ) , FIDO2 and WebAuthn , Yubico OTP , Personal Identity Verification (PIV) , OpenPGP , TOTP and HOTP authentication. One of the benefits of the YubiKey is that one key can do almost everything (YubiKey 5), you could expect from a hardware security key. We do encourage you to take the quiz before purchasing in order to make sure you make the right choice. Website Privacy Policy The comparison table shows the features and how the YubiKeys compare. We highly recommend that you select keys from the YubiKey 5 Series. YubiKeys can be programmed using the YubiKey Manager or YubiKey Personalization Tools . For managing TOTP codes, you can use the Yubico Authenticator . All of Yubico's clients are open source. For models which support HOTP and TOTP , there are 2 slots in the OTP interface which could be used for HOTP and 32 slots to store TOTP secrets. These secrets are stored encrypted on the key and never expose them to the devices they are plugged into. Once a seed (shared secret) is given to the Yubico Authenticator, it will only give out the six-digit codes, but never the seed. This security model helps limit what an attacker can do if they compromise one of the devices running the Yubico Authenticator and make the YubiKey resistant to a physical attacker. Warning The firmware of YubiKeys are not open source and are not updatable. If you want features in newer firmware versions, or if there is a vulnerability in the firmware version you are using, you would need to purchase a new key. Nitrokey / Librem Key \u00b6 Recommendation Nitrokey has a security key capable of FIDO2 and WebAuthn called the Nitrokey FIDO2 .

Nitrokey models can be configured using the Nitrokey app . For the models which support HOTP and TOTP , there are 3 slots for HOTP and 15 for TOTP . Some Nitrokeys can act as a password manager. They can store 16 different credentials and encrypt them using the same password as the OpenPGP interface. Warning While Nitrokeys do not release the HOTP / TOTP secrets to the device they are plugged into, the HOTP and TOTP storage is not encrypted and is vulnerable to physical attacks. Warning Resetting the OpenPGP interface on a Nitrokey will also make the password database inaccessible . The Nitrokey Pro 2, Nitrokey Storage 2, and the upcoming Nitrokey 3 supports system integrity verification for laptops with the Coreboot + Heads firmware. Purism's Librem Key is a rebranded NitroKey Pro 2 with similar firmware and can also be used for the same purposes. The Nitrokey has an open source firmware, unlike the YubiKey. The firmware on modern NitroKey models (except the NitroKey Pro 2 ) is updatable. Tip The Nitrokey app, while compatible with Librem Keys, requires libnitrokey version 3.6 or above to recognize them. Currently, the package is outdated on Windows, macOS, and most Linux distributions' repository, so you will likely have to compile the Nitrokey app yourself to get it working with the Librem Key. On Linux, you can obtain an up-to-date version from Flathub . Authenticator Apps \u00b6 Authenticator Apps implement a security standard adopted by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) called Time-based One-time Passwords , or TOTP . This is a method where websites share a secret with you which is used by your authenticator app to generate a six (usually) digit code based on the current time, which you enter while logging in for the website to check. Typically these codes are regenerated every 30 seconds, and once a new code is generated the old one becomes useless. Even if a hacker gets one six-digit code, there is no way for them to reverse that code to get the original secret, or otherwise be able to predict what any future codes might be.

The client software was independently audited and the anonymous routing protocol uses the Tor network which has also been audited. Briar has a fully published specification . Briar supports perfect forward secrecy by using the Bramble Handshake and Transport protocol. Session \u00b6 Recommendation Session is a decentralized messenger with a focus on private, secure, and anonymous communications. Session offers support for direct messages, group chats, and voice calls. Session utilizes the decentralized Oxen Service Node Network to store and route messages. Every encrypted message is routed through three nodes in the Oxen Service Node Network, making it virtually impossible for the nodes to compile meaningful information on those using the network. Homepage Privacy Policy Downloads Windows macOS App Store Linux Google Play f-droid F-Droid Source Session allows for E2EE in one-on-one chats or closed groups which allow for up to 100 members. Open groups have no restriction on the number of members, but are open by design. Session does not support perfect forward secrecy, which is when an encryption system automatically and frequently changes the keys it uses to encrypt and decrypt information, such that if the latest key is compromised it exposes a smaller portion of sensitive information. Oxen requested an independent audit for Session in March of 2020. The audit concluded in April of 2021, \u201cThe overall security level of this application is good and makes it usable for privacy-concerned people.\u201d Session has a whitepaper describing the technicals of the app and protocol. Types of Communication Networks \u00b6 There are several network architectures commonly used to relay messages between people. These networks can provide different different privacy guarantees, which is why it's worth considering your threat model when making a decision about which app to use. Centralized Networks \u00b6 Centralized messengers are those where all participants are on the same server or network of servers controlled by the same organization. Some self-hosted messengers allow you to set up your own server. Self-hosting can provide additional privacy guarantees such as no usage logs or limited access to metadata (data about who is talking to whom). Self-hosted centralized messengers are isolated and everyone must be on the same server to communicate. Advantages: New features and changes can be implemented more quickly. Easier to get started with and to find contacts. Most mature and stable features ecosystems, as they are easier to program in a centralized software. Privacy issues may be reduced when you trust a server that you're self-hosting. Disadvantages: Can include restricted control or access . This can include things like: Being forbidden from connecting third-party clients to the centralized network that might provide for greater customization or a better experience. Often defined in Terms and Conditions of usage. Poor or no documentation for third-party developers. The ownership , privacy policy, and operations of the service can change easily when a single entity controls it, potentially compromising the service later on. Self hosting requires effort and knowledge of how to set up a service. Federated Networks \u00b6 Federated messengers use multiple, independent, decentralized servers that are able to talk to each other (email is one example of a federated service). Federation allows system administrators to control their own server and still be a part of the larger communications network. When self-hosted, members of a federated server can discover and communicate with members of other servers, although some servers may choose to remain private by being non-federated (e.g., work team server). Advantages: Allows for greater control over your own data when running your own server. Allows you to choose who to trust your data with by choosing between multiple \"public\" servers. Often allows for third party clients which can provide a more native, customized, or accessible experience. Server software can be verified that it matches public source code, assuming you have access to the server or you trust the person who does (e.g., a family member) Disadvantages: Adding new features is more complex, because these features need to be standardized and tested to ensure they work with all servers on the network. Due to the previous point, features can be lacking, or incomplete or working in unexpected ways compared to centralized platforms, such as message relay when offline or message deletion. Some metadata may be available (e.g., information like \"who is talking to whom,\" but not actual message content if E2EE is used). Federated servers generally require trusting your server's administrator. They may be a hobbyist or otherwise not a \"security professional,\" and may not serve standard documents like a privacy policy or terms of service detailing how your data is utilized. Server administrators sometimes choose to block other servers, which are a source of unmoderated abuse or break general rules of accepted behavior. This will hinder your ability to communicate with members of those servers. Peer-to-Peer Networks \u00b6 P2P messengers connect to a distributed network of nodes to relay a message to the recepient without a third-party server. Clients (peers) usually find each other through the use of a distributed computing network. Examples of this include Distributed Hash Tables (DHT), used by torrents and IPFS for example. Another approach is proximity based networks, where a connection is established over WiFi or Bluetooth (for example, Briar or the Scuttlebutt social network protocol). Once a peer has found a route to its contact via any of these methods, a direct connection between them is made. Although messages are usually encrypted, an observer can still deduce the location and identity of the sender and recipient. P2P networks do not use servers, as peers communicate directly between each other, and hence cannot be self-hosted. However, some additional services may rely on centralized servers, such as user discovery or relaying offline messages, which can benefit from self-hosting. Advantages: Minimal information is exposed to third parties. Modern P2P platforms implement E2EE by default. There are no servers that could potentially intercept and decrypt your transmissions, unlike centralized and federated models. Disadvantages: Reduced feature set: Messages can only be sent when both peers are online, however, your client may store messages locally to wait for the contact to return online. Generally increases battery usage on mobile devices, because the client must stay connected to the distributed network to learn about who is online. Some common messenger features may not be implemented or incompletely, such as message deletion. Your IP address and that of the contacts you're communicating with may be exposed if you do not use the software in conjunction with a VPN or self contained network , such as Tor or I2P . Many countries have some form of mass surveillance and/or metadata retention. Anonymous Routing \u00b6 A messenger using anonymous routing hides either the identity of the sender, the receiver, or evidence that they have been communicating. Ideally, a messenger should hide all three. There are many different ways to implement anonymous routing. One of the most famous is onion routing (i.e. Tor ), which communicates encrypted messages through a virtual overlay network that hides the location of each node as well as the recipient and sender of each message. The sender and recipient never interact directly, and only meet through a secret rendezvous node, so that there is no leak of IP addresses nor physical location. Nodes cannot decrypt messages nor the final destination, only the recipient can. Each intermediary node can only decrypt a part that indicates where to send the still encrypted message next, until it arrives at the recipient who can fully decrypt it, hence the \"onion layers\". Self-hosting a node in an anonymous routing network does not provide the hoster with additional privacy benefits, but rather contributes to the whole network's resilience against identification attacks for everyone's benefit. Advantages: Minimal to no information is exposed to other parties. Messages can be relayed in a decentralized manner even if one of the parties is offline. Disadvantages: Slow message propagation. Often limited to fewer media types, mostly text since the network is slow. Less reliable if nodes are selected by randomized routing, some nodes may be very far from the sender and receiver, adding latency or even failing to transmit messages if one of the nodes goes offline. More complex to get started as the creation and secured backup of a cryptographic private key is required. Just like other decentralized platforms, adding features is more complex for developers than on a centralized platform, hence features may be lacking or incompletely implemented, such as offline message relaying or message deletion.","title":"Real-Time Communication"},{"location":"real-time-communication/#encrypted-instant-messengers","text":"","title":"Encrypted Instant Messengers"},{"location":"real-time-communication/#signal","text":"Recommendation Signal is a mobile app developed by Signal Messenger LLC.

The audit concluded in April of 2021, \u201cThe overall security level of this application is good and makes it usable for privacy-concerned people.\u201d Session has a whitepaper describing the technicals of the app and protocol.","title":"Session"},{"location":"real-time-communication/#types-of-communication-networks","text":"There are several network architectures commonly used to relay messages between people. These networks can provide different different privacy guarantees, which is why it's worth considering your threat model when making a decision about which app to use.","title":"Types of Communication Networks"},{"location":"real-time-communication/#centralized-networks","text":"Centralized messengers are those where all participants are on the same server or network of servers controlled by the same organization. Some self-hosted messengers allow you to set up your own server. Self-hosting can provide additional privacy guarantees such as no usage logs or limited access to metadata (data about who is talking to whom). Self-hosted centralized messengers are isolated and everyone must be on the same server to communicate. Advantages: New features and changes can be implemented more quickly. Easier to get started with and to find contacts. Most mature and stable features ecosystems, as they are easier to program in a centralized software. Privacy issues may be reduced when you trust a server that you're self-hosting. Disadvantages: Can include restricted control or access . This can include things like: Being forbidden from connecting third-party clients to the centralized network that might provide for greater customization or a better experience. Often defined in Terms and Conditions of usage. Poor or no documentation for third-party developers. The ownership , privacy policy, and operations of the service can change easily when a single entity controls it, potentially compromising the service later on. Self hosting requires effort and knowledge of how to set up a service.","title":"Centralized Networks"},{"location":"real-time-communication/#federated-networks","text":"Federated messengers use multiple, independent, decentralized servers that are able to talk to each other (email is one example of a federated service). Federation allows system administrators to control their own server and still be a part of the larger communications network. When self-hosted, members of a federated server can discover and communicate with members of other servers, although some servers may choose to remain private by being non-federated (e.g., work team server). Advantages: Allows for greater control over your own data when running your own server. Allows you to choose who to trust your data with by choosing between multiple \"public\" servers. Often allows for third party clients which can provide a more native, customized, or accessible experience. Server software can be verified that it matches public source code, assuming you have access to the server or you trust the person who does (e.g., a family member) Disadvantages: Adding new features is more complex, because these features need to be standardized and tested to ensure they work with all servers on the network. Due to the previous point, features can be lacking, or incomplete or working in unexpected ways compared to centralized platforms, such as message relay when offline or message deletion. Some metadata may be available (e.g., information like \"who is talking to whom,\" but not actual message content if E2EE is used). Federated servers generally require trusting your server's administrator. They may be a hobbyist or otherwise not a \"security professional,\" and may not serve standard documents like a privacy policy or terms of service detailing how your data is utilized. Server administrators sometimes choose to block other servers, which are a source of unmoderated abuse or break general rules of accepted behavior. This will hinder your ability to communicate with members of those servers.","title":"Federated Networks"},{"location":"real-time-communication/#peer-to-peer-networks","text":"P2P messengers connect to a distributed network of nodes to relay a message to the recepient without a third-party server. Clients (peers) usually find each other through the use of a distributed computing network. Examples of this include Distributed Hash Tables (DHT), used by torrents and IPFS for example. Another approach is proximity based networks, where a connection is established over WiFi or Bluetooth (for example, Briar or the Scuttlebutt social network protocol). Once a peer has found a route to its contact via any of these methods, a direct connection between them is made. Although messages are usually encrypted, an observer can still deduce the location and identity of the sender and recipient. P2P networks do not use servers, as peers communicate directly between each other, and hence cannot be self-hosted. However, some additional services may rely on centralized servers, such as user discovery or relaying offline messages, which can benefit from self-hosting. Advantages: Minimal information is exposed to third parties. Modern P2P platforms implement E2EE by default. There are no servers that could potentially intercept and decrypt your transmissions, unlike centralized and federated models. Disadvantages: Reduced feature set: Messages can only be sent when both peers are online, however, your client may store messages locally to wait for the contact to return online. Generally increases battery usage on mobile devices, because the client must stay connected to the distributed network to learn about who is online. Some common messenger features may not be implemented or incompletely, such as message deletion. Your IP address and that of the contacts you're communicating with may be exposed if you do not use the software in conjunction with a VPN or self contained network , such as Tor or I2P . Many countries have some form of mass surveillance and/or metadata retention.","title":"Peer-to-Peer Networks"},{"location":"real-time-communication/#anonymous-routing","text":"A messenger using anonymous routing hides either the identity of the sender, the receiver, or evidence that they have been communicating. Ideally, a messenger should hide all three. There are many different ways to implement anonymous routing. One of the most famous is onion routing (i.e. Tor ), which communicates encrypted messages through a virtual overlay network that hides the location of each node as well as the recipient and sender of each message. The sender and recipient never interact directly, and only meet through a secret rendezvous node, so that there is no leak of IP addresses nor physical location. Nodes cannot decrypt messages nor the final destination, only the recipient can. Each intermediary node can only decrypt a part that indicates where to send the still encrypted message next, until it arrives at the recipient who can fully decrypt it, hence the \"onion layers\". Self-hosting a node in an anonymous routing network does not provide the hoster with additional privacy benefits, but rather contributes to the whole network's resilience against identification attacks for everyone's benefit. Advantages: Minimal to no information is exposed to other parties. Messages can be relayed in a decentralized manner even if one of the parties is offline. Disadvantages: Slow message propagation. Often limited to fewer media types, mostly text since the network is slow. Less reliable if nodes are selected by randomized routing, some nodes may be very far from the sender and receiver, adding latency or even failing to transmit messages if one of the nodes goes offline. More complex to get started as the creation and secured backup of a cryptographic private key is required. Just like other decentralized platforms, adding features is more complex for developers than on a centralized platform, hence features may be lacking or incompletely implemented, such as offline message relaying or message deletion.","title":"Anonymous Routing"},{"location":"router/","text":"Below are a few alternative operating systems, that can be used on routers, Wi-Fi access points etc. OpenWrt \u00b6 Recommendation OpenWrt is an operating system (in particular, an embedded operating system) based on the Linux kernel, primarily used on embedded devices to route network traffic.

More Info Recommended Providers \u00b6 Criteria Our recommended providers are outside the US, use encryption, accept Monero, support WireGuard & OpenVPN, and have a no logging policy. Read our full list of criteria for more information. Mullvad \u00b6 Recommendation Mullvad is a fast and inexpensive VPN with a serious focus on transparency and security. They have been in operation since 2009 . Mullvad is based in Sweden and does not have a free trial. EUR \u20ac60/year Website tor 38 Countries Mullvad has servers in 38 countries (1). Picking a VPN provider with a server nearest to you will reduce latency of the network traffic you send. This is because of a shorter route (less hops) to the destination. We also think it's better for the security of the VPN provider's private keys if they use dedicated servers , instead of cheaper shared solutions (with other customers) such as virtual private servers . As of 2022/05/17 Independently Audited Mullvad's VPN clients have been audited by Cure53 and Assured AB in a pentest report published at cure53.de . The security researchers concluded: Cure53 and Assured AB are happy with the results of the audit and the software leaves an overall positive impression. With security dedication of the in-house team at the Mullvad VPN compound, the testers have no doubts about the project being on the right track from a security standpoint. In 2020 a second audit was announced and the final audit report was made available on Cure53's website: The results of this May-June 2020 project targeting the Mullvad complex are quite positive. [...] The overall application ecosystem used by Mullvad leaves a sound and structured impression. The overall structure of the application makes it easy to roll out patches and fixes in a structured manner. More than anything, the findings spotted by Cure53 showcase the importance of constantly auditing and re-assessing the current leak vectors, in order to always ensure privacy of the end-users. With that being said, Mullvad does a great job protecting the end-user from common PII leaks and privacy related risks. In 2021 an infrastructure audit was announced and the final audit report was made available on Cure53's website. Open Source Clients Mullvad provides the source code for their desktop and mobile clients in their GitHub organization . Accepts Cash and Monero Mullvad, in addition to accepting credit/debit cards and PayPal, accepts Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Monero and cash/local currency as anonymous forms of payment. They also accept Swish and bank wire transfers. WireGuard Support Mullvad supports the WireGuard\u00ae protocol. WireGuard is a newer protocol that utilizes state-of-the-art cryptography . Additionally, WireGuard aims to be simpler and more performant. Mullvad recommends the use of WireGuard with their service. It is the default or only protocol on Mullvad's Android, iOS, macOS, and Linux apps, but on Windows you have to manually enable WireGuard. Mullvad also offers a WireGuard configuration generator for use with the official WireGuard apps . IPv6 Support Mullvad supports the future of networking IPv6 . Their network allows you to access services hosted on IPv6 as opposed to other providers who block IPv6 connections. Remote Port Forwarding Remote port forwarding is allowed for people who make one-time payments, but not allowed for accounts with a recurring/subscription-based payment method. This is to prevent Mullvad from being able to identify you based on your port usage and stored subscription information. See Port forwarding with Mullvad VPN for more information. Mobile Clients Mullvad has published App Store and Google Play clients, both supporting an easy-to use interface as opposed to requiring you to manually configure your WireGuard connection. The mobile client on Android is also available in F-Droid , which ensures that it is compiled with reproducible builds . Additional Functionality Mullvad is very transparent about which nodes they own or rent . They use ShadowSocks in their ShadowSocks + OpenVPN configuration, making them more resistant against firewalls with Deep Packet Inspection trying to block VPNs. Supposedly, China has to use a different method to block ShadowSocks servers . Mullvad's website is also accessible via Tor at o54hon2e2vj6c7m3aqqu6uyece65by3vgoxxhlqlsvkmacw6a7m7kiad.onion . ProtonVPN \u00b6 Recommendation ProtonVPN is a strong contender in the VPN space, and they have been in operation since 2016. ProtonVPN is based in Switzerland and offers a limited free pricing tier, as well as premium options. They offer a further 14% discount for buying a 2 year subscription. Free - Basic Plan USD $48/year - Plus Plan USD $96/year Website 63 Countries ProtonVPN has servers in 63 countries (1). Picking a VPN provider with a server nearest to you will reduce latency of the network traffic you send. This is because of a shorter route (less hops) to the destination. We also think it's better for the security of the VPN provider's private keys if they use dedicated servers , instead of cheaper shared solutions (with other customers) such as virtual private servers . As of 2022/05/17 Independently Audited As of January 2020 ProtonVPN has undergone an independent audit by SEC Consult. SEC Consult found some medium and low risk vulnerabilities in ProtonVPN's Windows, Android, and iOS applications, all of which were \"properly fixed\" by ProtonVPN before the reports were published. None of the issues identified would have provided an attacker remote access to your device or traffic. You can view individual reports for each platform at protonvpn.com . Open Source Clients ProtonVPN provides the source code for their desktop and mobile clients in their GitHub organization . Accepts Cash ProtonVPN, in addition to accepting credit/debit cards and PayPal, accepts Bitcoin, and cash/local currency as anonymous forms of payment. WireGuard Support ProtonVPN mostly supports the WireGuard\u00ae protocol. WireGuard is a newer protocol that utilizes state-of-the-art cryptography . Additionally, WireGuard aims to be simpler and more performant. ProtonVPN recommends the use of WireGuard with their service. On ProtonVPN's Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, ChromeOS, and Android TV apps, WireGuard is the default protocol; however, support for the protocol is not present in their Linux app. Remote Port Forwarding ProtonVPN currently only supports remote port forwarding on Windows, which may impact some applications. Especially Peer-to-Peer applications like Torrent clients. Mobile Clients In addition to providing standard OpenVPN configuration files, ProtonVPN has mobile clients for App Store and Google Play allowing for easy connections to their servers. The mobile client on Android is also available in F-Droid , which ensures that it is compiled with reproducible builds . Additional Functionality ProtonVPN have their own servers and datacenters in Switzerland, Iceland and Sweden. They offer adblocking and known malware domains blocking with their DNS service. Additionally, ProtonVPN also offers \"Tor\" servers allowing you to easily connect to onion sites, but we still strongly recommend using the official Tor Browser for this purpose. IVPN \u00b6 Recommendation IVPN is another premium VPN provider, and they have been in operation since 2009. IVPN is based in Gibraltar. Standard USD $60/year - Pro USD $100/year Website 32 Countries IVPN has servers in 32 countries (1). Picking a VPN provider with a server nearest to you will reduce latency of the network traffic you send. This is because of a shorter route (less hops) to the destination. We also think it's better for the security of the VPN provider's private keys if they use dedicated servers , instead of cheaper shared solutions (with other customers) such as virtual private servers . As of 2022/05/17 Independently Audited IVPN has undergone a no-logging audit from Cure53 which concluded in agreement with IVPN's no-logging claim. IVPN has also completed a comprehensive pentest report Cure53 in January 2020. IVPN has also said they plan to have annual reports in the future. Open Source Clients As of Feburary 2020 IVPN applications are now open source . Source code can be obtained from their GitHub organization . Accepts Cash and Monero In addition to accepting credit/debit cards and PayPal, IVPN accepts Bitcoin, Monero and cash/local currency (on annual plans) as anonymous forms of payment. WireGuard Support IVPN supports the WireGuard\u00ae protocol. WireGuard is a newer protocol that utilizes state-of-the-art cryptography . Additionally, WireGuard aims to be simpler and more performant. IVPN recommends the use of WireGuard with their service and, as such, the protocol is the default on all of IVPN's apps. IVPN also offers a WireGuard configuration generator for use with the official WireGuard apps . Remote Port Forwarding Remote port forwarding is possible with a Pro plan. Port forwarding can be activated via the client area. Port forwarding is only available on IVPN when using WireGuard or OpenVPN protocols and is disabled on US servers . Mobile Clients In addition to providing standard OpenVPN configuration files, IVPN has mobile clients for App Store and Google Play allowing for easy connections to their servers. The mobile client on Android is also available in F-Droid , which ensures that it is compiled with reproducible builds . Additional Functionality IVPN clients support two factor authentication (Mullvad and ProtonVPN clients do not). IVPN also provides \" AntiTracker \" functionality, which blocks advertising networks and trackers from the network level. Our Criteria \u00b6 Danger It is important to note that using a VPN provider will not make you anonymous, but it will give you better privacy in certain situations. A VPN is not a tool for illegal activities. Don't rely on a \"no log\" policy. Please note we are not affiliated with any of the providers we recommend. This allows us to provide completely objective recommendations. We have developed a clear set of requirements for any VPN provider wishing to be recommended, including strong encryption, independent security audits, modern technology, and more. We suggest you familiarize yourself with this list before choosing a VPN provider, and conduct your own research to ensure the VPN provider you choose is as trustworthy as possible. Jurisdiction \u00b6 Operating outside the five/nine/fourteen-eyes countries is not a guarantee of privacy necessarily, and there are other factors to consider. However, we believe that avoiding these countries is important if you wish to avoid mass government dragnet surveillance, especially from the United States. Minimum to Qualify: Operating outside the USA or other Five Eyes countries. Best Case: Operating outside the USA or other Fourteen Eyes countries. Operating inside a country with strong consumer protection laws. Technology \u00b6 We require all our recommended VPN providers to provide OpenVPN configuration files to be used in any client. If a VPN provides their own custom client, we require a killswitch to block network data leaks when disconnected. Minimum to Qualify: Support for strong protocols such as WireGuard & OpenVPN. Killswitch built in to clients. Multihop support. Multihopping is important to keep data private in case of a single node compromise. If VPN clients are provided, they should be open source , like the VPN software they generally have built into them. We believe that source code availability provides greater transparency about what your device is actually doing. We like to see these applications available in F-Droid . Best Case: WireGuard and OpenVPN support. Killswitch with highly configurable options (enable/disable on certain networks, on boot, etc.) Easy-to-use VPN clients Supports IPv6 . We expect that servers will allow incoming connections via IPv6 and allow you to access services hosted on IPv6 addresses. Capability of remote port forwarding assists in creating connections when using P2P ( Peer-to-Peer ) filesharing software, Freenet, or hosting a server (e.g., Mumble). Privacy \u00b6 We prefer our recommended providers to collect as little data as possible. Not collecting personal information on registration, and accepting anonymous forms of payment are required. Minimum to Qualify: Monero or cash payment option. No personal information required to register: Only username, password, and email at most. Best Case: Accepts Monero, cash, and other forms of anonymous payment options (gift cards, etc.) No personal information accepted (autogenerated username, no email required, etc.) Security \u00b6 A VPN is pointless if it can't even provide adequate security. We require all our recommended providers to abide by current security standards for their OpenVPN connections. Ideally, they would use more future-proof encryption schemes by default. We also require an independent third-party to audit the provider's security, ideally in a very comprehensive manner and on a repeated (yearly) basis. Minimum to Qualify: Strong Encryption Schemes: OpenVPN with SHA-256 authentication; RSA-2048 or better handshake; AES-256-GCM or AES-256-CBC data encryption. Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS). Published security audits from a reputable third-party firm. Best Case: Strongest Encryption: RSA-4096. Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS). Comprehensive published security audits from a reputable third-party firm. Bug-bounty programs and/or a coordinated vulnerability-disclosure process. Trust \u00b6 You wouldn't trust your finances to someone with a fake identity, so why trust them with your internet data? We require our recommended providers to be public about their ownership or leadership. We also would like to see frequent transparency reports, especially in regard to how government requests are handled. Minimum to Qualify: Public-facing leadership or ownership. Best Case: Public-facing leadership. Frequent transparency reports. Marketing \u00b6 With the VPN providers we recommend we like to see responsible marketing. Minimum to Qualify: Must self host analytics (no Google Analytics etc). The provider's site must also comply with DNT (Do Not Track) for people who want to opt-out. Must not have any marketing which is irresponsible: Making guarantees of protecting anonymity 100%. When someone makes a claim that something is 100% it means there is no certainty for failure. We know people can quite easily deanonymize themselves in a number of ways, eg: Reusing personal information eg. (email accounts, unique pseudonyms etc) that they accessed without anonymity software (Tor, VPN etc) Browser fingerprinting Claim that a single circuit VPN is \"more anonymous\" than Tor, which is a circuit of 3 or more hops that regularly changes. Use responsible language, eg it is okay to say that a VPN is \"disconnected\" or \"not connected\", however claiming that someone is \"exposed\", \"vulnerable\" or \"compromised\" is needless use of alarming language that may be incorrect. For example, that person might simply be on another VPN provider's service or using Tor. Best Case: Responsible marketing that is both educational and useful to the consumer could include: An accurate comparison to when Tor or other self-contained networks should be used. Availability of the VPN provider's website over a .onion Hidden Service Additional Functionality \u00b6 While not strictly requirements, there are some factors we looked into when determining which providers to recommend. These include adblocking/tracker-blocking functionality, warrant canaries, multihop connections, excellent customer support, the number of allowed simultaneous connections, etc. VPN Overview \u00b6 Should I use a VPN ? \u00b6 Yes , unless you are already using Tor. A VPN does 2 things: shifting the risks from your Internet Service Provider to itself and hiding your IP from a third party service. VPNs cannot encrypt data outside of the connection between your device and the VPN server. VPN providers can see and modify your traffic the same way your ISP could. And there is no way to verify a VPN provider's \"no logging\" policies in any way. However, they do hide your actual IP from a third party service, provided that there are no IP leaks. They help you blend in with others and mitigate IP based tracking. What about encryption? \u00b6 Encryption offered by VPN providers are between your devices and their servers. It guarantees that this specific link is secure. This is a step up from using unencrypted proxies where an adversary on the network can intercept the communications between your devices and said proxies and modify them. However, encryption between your apps or browsers with the service providers are not handled by this encryption. In order to keep what you actually do on the websites you visit private and secure, you must use HTTPS . This will keep your passwords, session tokens, and queries safe from the VPN provider. Consider enabling \" HTTPS everywhere\" in your browser to mitigate downgrade attacks like SSL Strip . Should I use encrypted DNS with a VPN ? \u00b6 Unless your VPN provider hosts the encrypted DNS servers, no . Using DOH/DOT (or any other form of encrypted DNS ) with third party servers will simply add more entities to trust, and does absolutely nothing to improve your privacy/security. Your VPN provider can still see which websites you visit based on the IP addresses and other methods. Instead of just trusting your VPN provider, you are now trusting both the VPN provider and the DNS provider. A common reason to recommend encrypted DNS is that it helps against DNS spoofing. However, your browser should already be checking for TLS certificates with HTTPS and warn you about it. If you are not using HTTPS , then an adversary can still just modify anything other than your DNS queries and the end result will be little different. Needless to say, you shouldn't use encrypted DNS with Tor . This would direct all of your DNS requests through a single circuit, and would allow the encrypted DNS provider to deanonymize you. Should I use Tor and a VPN ? \u00b6 By using a VPN with Tor, you're creating essentially a permanent entry node, often with a money trail attached. This provides zero additional benefit to you, while increasing the attack surface of your connection dramatically. If you wish to hide your Tor usage from your ISP or your government, Tor has a built-in solution for that: Tor bridges. Read more about Tor bridges and why using a VPN is not necessary . What if I need anonymity? \u00b6 VPNs cannot provide anonymity. Your VPN provider will still see your real IP address, and often has a money trail that can be linked directly back to you. You cannot rely on \"no logging\" policies to protect your data. Use Tor instead. What about VPN providers that provides Tor nodes? \u00b6 Do not use that feature. The point of using Tor is that you do not trust your VPN provider. Currently Tor only supports the TCP protocol. UDP (used in WebRTC for voice and video sharing, the new http3/QUIC protocol, etc), ICMP and other packets will be dropped. To compensate for this, VPN providers typically will route all non TCP packets through their VPN server (your first hop). This is the case with ProtonVPN . Additionally, when using this Tor over VPN setup, you do not have control over other important Tor features such as Isolated Destination Address (using a different Tor circuit for every domain you visit). Thus, this feature should be viewed as a convenient way to access the Tor Network, not to stay annonymous. For true anonimity, use the Tor Browser Bundle, TorSocks, or a Tor gateway. When are VPNs useful? \u00b6 A VPN may still be useful to you in a variety of scenarios, such as: Hiding your traffic from only your Internet Service Provider. Hiding your downloads (such as torrents) from your ISP and anti-piracy organizations. Hiding your IP from third party websites and services, preventing IP based tracking. For use cases like these, or if you have another compelling reason, the VPN providers we listed above are who we think are the most trustworthy. However, using a VPN provider still means you're trusting the provider. In pretty much any other scenario you should be using a secure -by-design tool such as Tor.

None of the issues identified would have provided an attacker remote access to your device or traffic. You can view individual reports for each platform at protonvpn.com . Open Source Clients ProtonVPN provides the source code for their desktop and mobile clients in their GitHub organization . Accepts Cash ProtonVPN, in addition to accepting credit/debit cards and PayPal, accepts Bitcoin, and cash/local currency as anonymous forms of payment. WireGuard Support ProtonVPN mostly supports the WireGuard\u00ae protocol. WireGuard is a newer protocol that utilizes state-of-the-art cryptography . Additionally, WireGuard aims to be simpler and more performant. ProtonVPN recommends the use of WireGuard with their service. On ProtonVPN's Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, ChromeOS, and Android TV apps, WireGuard is the default protocol; however, support for the protocol is not present in their Linux app. Remote Port Forwarding ProtonVPN currently only supports remote port forwarding on Windows, which may impact some applications. Especially Peer-to-Peer applications like Torrent clients. Mobile Clients In addition to providing standard OpenVPN configuration files, ProtonVPN has mobile clients for App Store and Google Play allowing for easy connections to their servers. The mobile client on Android is also available in F-Droid , which ensures that it is compiled with reproducible builds . Additional Functionality ProtonVPN have their own servers and datacenters in Switzerland, Iceland and Sweden. They offer adblocking and known malware domains blocking with their DNS service. Additionally, ProtonVPN also offers \"Tor\" servers allowing you to easily connect to onion sites, but we still strongly recommend using the official Tor Browser for this purpose.","title":"ProtonVPN"},{"location":"vpn/#ivpn","text":"Recommendation IVPN is another premium VPN provider, and they have been in operation since 2009. IVPN is based in Gibraltar. Standard USD $60/year - Pro USD $100/year Website 32 Countries IVPN has servers in 32 countries (1). Picking a VPN provider with a server nearest to you will reduce latency of the network traffic you send. This is because of a shorter route (less hops) to the destination. We also think it's better for the security of the VPN provider's private keys if they use dedicated servers , instead of cheaper shared solutions (with other customers) such as virtual private servers . As of 2022/05/17 Independently Audited IVPN has undergone a no-logging audit from Cure53 which concluded in agreement with IVPN's no-logging claim. IVPN has also completed a comprehensive pentest report Cure53 in January 2020. IVPN has also said they plan to have annual reports in the future. Open Source Clients As of Feburary 2020 IVPN applications are now open source . Source code can be obtained from their GitHub organization . Accepts Cash and Monero In addition to accepting credit/debit cards and PayPal, IVPN accepts Bitcoin, Monero and cash/local currency (on annual plans) as anonymous forms of payment. WireGuard Support IVPN supports the WireGuard\u00ae protocol. WireGuard is a newer protocol that utilizes state-of-the-art cryptography . Additionally, WireGuard aims to be simpler and more performant. IVPN recommends the use of WireGuard with their service and, as such, the protocol is the default on all of IVPN's apps. IVPN also offers a WireGuard configuration generator for use with the official WireGuard apps . Remote Port Forwarding Remote port forwarding is possible with a Pro plan. Port forwarding can be activated via the client area. Port forwarding is only available on IVPN when using WireGuard or OpenVPN protocols and is disabled on US servers . Mobile Clients In addition to providing standard OpenVPN configuration files, IVPN has mobile clients for App Store and Google Play allowing for easy connections to their servers. The mobile client on Android is also available in F-Droid , which ensures that it is compiled with reproducible builds .

A VPN is not a tool for illegal activities. Don't rely on a \"no log\" policy. Please note we are not affiliated with any of the providers we recommend. This allows us to provide completely objective recommendations. We have developed a clear set of requirements for any VPN provider wishing to be recommended, including strong encryption, independent security audits, modern technology, and more. We suggest you familiarize yourself with this list before choosing a VPN provider, and conduct your own research to ensure the VPN provider you choose is as trustworthy as possible.","title":"Our Criteria"},{"location":"vpn/#jurisdiction","text":"Operating outside the five/nine/fourteen-eyes countries is not a guarantee of privacy necessarily, and there are other factors to consider.

Killswitch built in to clients. Multihop support. Multihopping is important to keep data private in case of a single node compromise. If VPN clients are provided, they should be open source , like the VPN software they generally have built into them. We believe that source code availability provides greater transparency about what your device is actually doing. We like to see these applications available in F-Droid . Best Case: WireGuard and OpenVPN support. Killswitch with highly configurable options (enable/disable on certain networks, on boot, etc.) Easy-to-use VPN clients Supports IPv6 . We expect that servers will allow incoming connections via IPv6 and allow you to access services hosted on IPv6 addresses.

(email accounts, unique pseudonyms etc) that they accessed without anonymity software (Tor, VPN etc) Browser fingerprinting Claim that a single circuit VPN is \"more anonymous\" than Tor, which is a circuit of 3 or more hops that regularly changes. Use responsible language, eg it is okay to say that a VPN is \"disconnected\" or \"not connected\", however claiming that someone is \"exposed\", \"vulnerable\" or \"compromised\" is needless use of alarming language that may be incorrect. For example, that person might simply be on another VPN provider's service or using Tor.

A VPN does 2 things: shifting the risks from your Internet Service Provider to itself and hiding your IP from a third party service. VPNs cannot encrypt data outside of the connection between your device and the VPN server. VPN providers can see and modify your traffic the same way your ISP could. And there is no way to verify a VPN provider's \"no logging\" policies in any way. However, they do hide your actual IP from a third party service, provided that there are no IP leaks. They help you blend in with others and mitigate IP based tracking.","title":"Should I use a VPN?"},{"location":"vpn/#what-about-encryption","text":"Encryption offered by VPN providers are between your devices and their servers. It guarantees that this specific link is secure. This is a step up from using unencrypted proxies where an adversary on the network can intercept the communications between your devices and said proxies and modify them. However, encryption between your apps or browsers with the service providers are not handled by this encryption. In order to keep what you actually do on the websites you visit private and secure, you must use HTTPS . This will keep your passwords, session tokens, and queries safe from the VPN provider. Consider enabling \" HTTPS everywhere\" in your browser to mitigate downgrade attacks like SSL Strip .","title":"What about encryption?"},{"location":"vpn/#should-i-use-encrypted-dns-with-a-vpn","text":"Unless your VPN provider hosts the encrypted DNS servers, no . Using DOH/DOT (or any other form of encrypted DNS ) with third party servers will simply add more entities to trust, and does absolutely nothing to improve your privacy/security. Your VPN provider can still see which websites you visit based on the IP addresses and other methods. Instead of just trusting your VPN provider, you are now trusting both the VPN provider and the DNS provider. A common reason to recommend encrypted DNS is that it helps against DNS spoofing. However, your browser should already be checking for TLS certificates with HTTPS and warn you about it. If you are not using HTTPS , then an adversary can still just modify anything other than your DNS queries and the end result will be little different. Needless to say, you shouldn't use encrypted DNS with Tor . This would direct all of your DNS requests through a single circuit, and would allow the encrypted DNS provider to deanonymize you.","title":"Should I use encrypted DNS with a VPN?"},{"location":"vpn/#should-i-use-tor-and-a-vpn","text":"By using a VPN with Tor, you're creating essentially a permanent entry node, often with a money trail attached. This provides zero additional benefit to you, while increasing the attack surface of your connection dramatically. If you wish to hide your Tor usage from your ISP or your government, Tor has a built-in solution for that: Tor bridges. Read more about Tor bridges and why using a VPN is not necessary .","title":"Should I use Tor and a VPN?"},{"location":"vpn/#what-if-i-need-anonymity","text":"VPNs cannot provide anonymity. Your VPN provider will still see your real IP address, and often has a money trail that can be linked directly back to you. You cannot rely on \"no logging\" policies to protect your data. Use Tor instead.","title":"What if I need anonymity?"},{"location":"vpn/#what-about-vpn-providers-that-provides-tor-nodes","text":"Do not use that feature. The point of using Tor is that you do not trust your VPN provider. Currently Tor only supports the TCP protocol. UDP (used in WebRTC for voice and video sharing, the new http3/QUIC protocol, etc), ICMP and other packets will be dropped. To compensate for this, VPN providers typically will route all non TCP packets through their VPN server (your first hop). This is the case with ProtonVPN . Additionally, when using this Tor over VPN setup, you do not have control over other important Tor features such as Isolated Destination Address (using a different Tor circuit for every domain you visit). Thus, this feature should be viewed as a convenient way to access the Tor Network, not to stay annonymous. For true anonimity, use the Tor Browser Bundle, TorSocks, or a Tor gateway.","title":"What about VPN providers that provides Tor nodes?"},{"location":"vpn/#when-are-vpns-useful","text":"A VPN may still be useful to you in a variety of scenarios, such as: Hiding your traffic from only your Internet Service Provider.

For use cases like these, or if you have another compelling reason, the VPN providers we listed above are who we think are the most trustworthy.

Permissions for apps to use Google Play Services can be revoked at any time. microG is an open-source re-implementation of Google Play Services. This means it needs to be updated every time Android has a major version update (or the Android API changes). It also needs to run in the highly privileged system_app SELinux domain like regular Google Play Services, and it requires an operating system that allows signature spoofing , which allows system apps to insecurely masquerade as other apps. This is less secure than Sandboxed Google Play's approach, which does not need access to sensitive system APIs. When using Sandboxed Play Services, you have the option to reroute location requests to the Play Services API back to the OS location API which uses satellite based location services. With microG, you have the option to either not use a network location backend at all, shift trust to another location backend like Mozilla, or use DejaVu , a location backend that locally collects and saves RF-based location data to an offline database which can be used when GPS is not available. Network location providers like Play Services or Mozilla rely the on the MAC addresses of surrounding WiFi access points and Bluetooth devices being submitted for location approximation. Choosing a network location like Mozilla to use with microG provides little to no privacy benefit over Google because you are still submitting the same data and trusting them to not profile you. Local RF location backends like DejaVu require that the phone has a working GPS first for the local RF data collected to be useful. This makes them ineffective as location providers, as the job of a location provider is to assist location approximation when satellite based services are not working. If your threat model requires protecting your location or the MAC addresses of nearby devices, rerouting location requests to the OS location API is probably the best option. The benefit brought by microG's custom location backend is minimal at best when compared to Sandboxed Play Services. In terms of application compatibility, Sandboxed Google Play outperforms microG due to its support for many services which microG has not yet implemented, like Google Play Games and In-app Billing API . Authentication using FIDO with online services on Android also relies on Play Services, and the feature is not yet implemented in microG. Privileged App Extensions \u00b6 Android 12 comes with special support for seamless app updates with third party app stores . The popular Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) repository F-Droid doesn't implement this feature and requires a privileged extension to be included with the Android distribution in order to have unattended app installation. GrapheneOS does not include F-Droid, because all updates have to be manually installed, which poses a security risk. However, you can use the Neo Store client for F-Droid which does support seamless (background) app updates in Android 12. GrapheneOS officially recommends Sandboxed Google Play instead. Many FOSS Android apps are also in Google Play but sometimes they are not (like NewPipe ). CalyxOS includes the privileged extension , which may lower device security. Seamless app updates should be possible with Aurora Store in Android 12. Additional hardening \u00b6 GrapheneOS improves upon AOSP security with: Hardened WebView: Vanadium WebView requires 64-bit processes on the WebView process and disables legacy 32-bit processes. It uses hardened compiler options such as -fwrapv and -fstack-protector-strong , which can help protect against stack buffer overflows . API s such as the battery status API are disabled for privacy reasons. All system apps on GrapheneOS use the Vanadium WebView which means that apps which use WebView will also benefit from Vanadium's hardening. The Vanadium patch set is a lot more comprehensive than CalyxOS's Chromium patch set which is derived from it. Hardened Kernel: GrapheneOS kernel includes some hardening from the linux-hardened project and the Kernel Self Protection Project (KSPP) . CalyxOS uses the same kernel as regular Android with some minor modifications. Hardened Memory Allocator: GrapheneOS uses the hardened malloc subproject as its memory allocator. This focuses on hardening against memory heap corruption . CalyxOS uses the default AOSP Scudo Malloc , which is generally less effective . Hardened Malloc has uncovered vulnerabilities in AOSP which have been fixed by GrapheneOS such as CVE-2021-0703 . Secure Exec Spawning: GrapheneOS spawns fresh processes as opposed to using the Zygote model used by AOSP and CalyxOS. The Zygote model weakens Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) and is considered less secure . Creating fresh processes is safer but will have some performance penalty when launching a new application. These penalties are not really noticeable unless you have an old device with slow storage such as the Pixel 3a/3a XL as it has eMMC . Please note that these are just a few examples and are not an extensive list of GrapheneOS's hardening . For a more complete list, please read GrapheneOS' official documentation .","title":"GrapheneOS vs CalyxOS"},{"location":"android/grapheneos-vs-calyxos/#profiles","text":"CalyxOS includes a device controller app so there is no need to install a third party app like Shelter.

Choosing an Android Distribution \u00b6 When you buy an Android phone, the device's default operating system often comes with invasive integration with apps and services that are not part of the Android Open Source Project . An example of such is Google Play Services, which has unrevokable privileges to access your files, contacts storage, call logs, SMS messages, location, camera, microphone, hardware identifiers, and so on. These apps and services increase the attack surface of your device and are the source of various privacy concerns with Android. This problem could be solved by using a custom Android distribution that does not come with such invasive integration. Unfortunately, many custom Android distributions often violate the Android security model by not supporting critical security features such as AVB , rollback protection, firmware updates, and so on. Some distributions also ship userdebug builds which expose root via ADB and require more permissive SELinux policies to accomodate debugging features, resulting in a further increased attack surface and weakened security model. Ideally, when choosing a custom Android distribution, you should make sure that it upholds the Android security model. At the very least, the distribution should have production builds, support for AVB , rollback protection, timely firmware and operating system updates, and SELinux in enforcing mode . All of our recommended Android distributions satisfy these criteria. Our Android System Recommendations Avoid Rooting \u00b6 Rooting Android phones can decrease security significantly as it weakens the complete Android security model . This can decrease privacy should there be an exploit that is assisted by the decreased security. Common rooting methods involve directly tampering with the boot partition, making it impossible to perform successful Verified Boot. Apps that require root will also modify the system partition meaning that Verified Boot would have to remain disabled. Having root exposed directly in the user interface also increases the attack surface of your device and may assist in privilege escalation vulnerabilities and SELinux policy bypasses. Adblockers which modify the hosts file (AdAway) and firewalls (AFWall+) which require root access persistently are dangerous and should not be used. They are also not the correct way to solve their intended purposes. For Adblocking we suggest encrypted DNS or VPN server blocking solutions instead. RethinkDNS, TrackerControl and AdAway in non-root mode will take up the VPN slot (by using a local loopback VPN ) preventing you from using privacy enhancing services such as Orbot or a real VPN server. AFWall+ works based on the packet filtering approach and may be bypassable in some situations. We do not believe that the security sacrifices made by rooting a phone are worth the questionable privacy benefits of those apps. Verified Boot \u00b6 Verified Boot is an important part of the Android security model. It provides protection against evil maid attacks, malware persistence, and ensures security updates cannot be downgraded with rollback protection . Android 10 and above has moved away from full-disk encryption to more flexible file-based encryption . Your data is encrypted using unique encryption keys, and the operating system files are left unencrypted. Verified Boot ensures the integrity of the operating system files, thereby preventing an adversary with physical access from tampering or installing malware on the device. In the unlikely case that malware is able to exploit other parts of the system and gain higher privileged access, Verified Boot will prevent and revert changes to the system partition upon rebooting device. Unfortunately, OEMs are only obliged to support Verified Boot on their stock Android distribution. Only a few OEMs such as Google support custom AVB key enrollment on their devices. Additionally, some AOSP derivatives such as LineageOS or /e/ OS do not support Verified Boot even on hardware with Verified Boot support for third party operating systems. We recommend that you check for support before purchasing a new device. AOSP derivatives which do not support Verified Boot are not recommended. Firmware Updates \u00b6 Firmware updates are critical for maintaining security and without them your device cannot be secure. OEMs have support agreements with their partners to provide the closed source components for a limited support period. These are detailed in the monthly Android Security Bulletins . As the components of the phone such as the processor and radio technologies rely on closed source components, the updates must be provided by the respective manufacturers. Therefore it is important that you purchase a device within an active support cycle. Qualcomm and Samsung support their devices for 4 years, while cheaper products often have shorter support cycles. With the introduction of the Pixel 6 , Google now makes their own SoC and they will provide a minimum of 5 years of support. EOL devices which are no longer supported by the SoC manufacturer cannot receive firmware updates from OEM vendors or after market Android distributors. This means that security issues with those devices will remain unfixed. Android Versions \u00b6 It's important to not use an end-of-life version of Android. Newer versions of Android not only receive security updates for the operating system but also important privacy enhancing updates too. For example, prior to Android 10 , any apps with the READ_PHONE_STATE permission could access sensitive and unique serial numbers of your phone such as IMEI , MEID , your SIM card's IMSI , whereas now they must be system apps to do so. System apps are only provided by the OEM or Android distribution. Android Permissions \u00b6 Permissions on Android grant you control over what apps are allowed to access. Google regularly makes improvements on the permission system in each successive version. All apps you install are strictly sandboxed , therefore there is no need to install any antivirus apps. The savings you make from not purchasing or subscribing to security apps is better spent on paying for a supported device in the future. Should you want to run an app that you're unsure about, consider using a user or work profile . User Profiles \u00b6 Multiple user profiles can be found in Settings \u2192 System \u2192 Multiple users and are the simplest way to isolate in Android. With user profiles, you can impose restrictions on a specific profile, such as: making calls, using SMS , or installing apps on the device. Each profile is encrypted using its own encryption key and cannot access the data of any other profiles. Even the device owner cannot view the data of other profiles without knowing their password. Multiple user profiles is a more secure method of isolation. Work Profile \u00b6 Work Profiles are another way to isolate individual apps and may be more convenient than separate user profiles. A device controller such as Shelter is required, unless you're using CalyxOS which includes one. The work profile is dependent on a device controller to function. Features such as File Shuttle and contact search blocking or any kind of isolation features must be implemented by the controller. You must also fully trust the device controller app, as it has full access to your data inside of the work profile. This method is generally less secure than a secondary user profile; however, it does allow you the convenience of running apps in both the work and personal profiles simultaneously. VPN Killswitch \u00b6 Android 7 and above supports a VPN killswitch and it is available without the need to install third party apps. This feature can prevent leaks if the VPN is disconnected. It can be found in ( Settings \u2192 Network & internet \u2192 VPN \u2192 \u2192 Block connections without VPN ). Global Toggles \u00b6 Modern Android devices have global toggles for disabling Bluetooth and location services. Android 12 introduced toggles for the camera and microphone. When not in use, we recommend disabling these features. Apps cannot use disabled features (even if granted individual permission) until re-enabled. Google \u00b6 If you are using a device with Google services, either your stock operating system or an operating system that safely sandboxes Google Play Services like GrapheneOS, there are a number of additional changes you can make to improve your privacy. We still recommend avoiding Google services entirely, or limiting Google Play services to a specific user/work profile by combining a device controller like Shelter with GrapheneOS's Sandboxed Google Play. Advanced Protection Program \u00b6 If you have a Google account we suggest enrolling in the Advanced Protection Program . It is available at no cost to anyone with two or more hardware security keys with FIDO support. The Advanced Protection Program provides enhanced threat monitoring and enables: Stricter two factor authentication; e.g. that FIDO must be used and disallows the use of SMS OTPs , TOTP , and OAuth Only Google and verified third party apps can access account data Scanning of incoming emails on Gmail accounts for phishing attempts Stricter safe browser scanning with Google Chrome Stricter recovery process for accounts with lost credentials If you use non-sandboxed Google Play Services (common on stock operating systems), the Advanced Protection Program also comes with additional benefits such as: Not allowing app installation outside of the Google Play Store, the OS vendor's app store, or via adb Mandatory automatic device scanning with Play Protect Warning you about unverified applications Google Play System Updates \u00b6 In the past, Android security updates had to be shipped by the operating system vendor. Android has become more modular beginning with Android 10, and Google can push security updates for some system components via the privileged Play Services. If you have an EOL device shipped with Android 10 or above and are unable to run any of our recommended operating systems on your device, you are likely going to be better off sticking with your OEM Android installation (as opposed to an operating system not listed here such as LineageOS or /e/ OS ). This will allow you to receive some security fixes from Google, while not violating the Android security model by using an insecure Android derivative and increasing your attack surface . We would still recommend upgrading to a supported device as soon as possible. Advertising ID \u00b6 All devices with Google Play Services installed automatically generate an advertising ID used for targeted advertising. Disable this feature to limit the data collected about you. On Android distributions with Sandboxed Google Play , go to Settings \u2192 Apps \u2192 Sandboxed Google Play \u2192 Google Settings \u2192 Ads , and select Delete advertising ID . On Android distributions with privileged Google Play Services (such as stock OSes), the setting may be in one of several locations. Check Settings \u2192 Google \u2192 Ads Settings \u2192 Privacy \u2192 Ads You will either be given the option to delete your advertising ID or to Opt out of interest-based ads , this varies between OEM distributions of Android. If presented with the option to delete the advertising ID that is preferred. If not, then make sure to opt out and reset your advertising ID. SafetyNet and Play Integrity API \u00b6 SafetyNet and the Play Integrity APIs are generally used for banking apps . Many banking apps will work fine in GrapheneOS with sandboxed Play services, however some non-financal apps have their own crude anti-tampering mechanisms which might fail. GrapheneOS passes the basicIntegrity check, but not the certification check ctsProfileMatch . Devices with Android 8 or later have hardware attestation support which cannot be bypassed without leaked keys or serious vulnerabilities. As for Google Wallet, we don't recommend this due to their privacy policy , which states you must opt-out if you don't want your credit rating and personal information shared with affiliate marketing services.","title":"Android Overview"},{"location":"android/overview/#choosing-an-android-distribution","text":"When you buy an Android phone, the device's default operating system often comes with invasive integration with apps and services that are not part of the Android Open Source Project .

On your email client, search for keywords such as \"verify\" or \"welcome.\" Almost every time you make an online account, the service will send a verification link or an introductory message to your email. This can be a good way to find old, forgotten accounts. Deleting Old Accounts \u00b6 Log In \u00b6 In order to delete your old accounts, you'll need to first make sure you can log in to them. Again, if the account was in your password manager, this step is easy. If not, you can try to guess your password. Failing that, there are typically options to regain access to your account, commonly available through a \"forgot password\" link on the login page. It may also be possible that accounts you've abandoned have already been deleted\u2014sometimes services prune all old accounts. When attempting to regain access, if the site returns an error message saying that email is not associated with an account, or you never receive a reset link after multiple attempts, then you do not have an account under that email address and should try a different one. If you can't figure out which email address you used, or you no longer have access to that email, you can try contacting the service's customer support. Unfortunately there is no guarantee that you will be able to reclaim access your account. GDPR ( EEA residents only) \u00b6 Residents of the EEA have additional rights regarding data erasure specified in Article 17 of the GDPR . If it's applicable to you, read the privacy policy for any given service to find information on how to exercise your right to erasure. Reading the privacy policy can prove important, as some services have a \"Delete Account\" option that only disables your account and for real deletion you have to take additional action. Sometimes actual deletion may involve filling out surveys, emailing the data protection officer of the service, or even proving your residence in the EEA . If you plan to go this way, do not overwrite account information\u2014your identity as an EEA resident may be required. Note that the location of the service does not matter; GDPR applies to anyone serving European users. If the service does not respect your right to erasure, you can contact your national Data Protection Authority and you may be entitled to monetary compensation. Overwriting Account information \u00b6 In some situations where you plan to abandon an account, it may make sense to overwrite the account information with fake data. Once you've made sure you can log in, change all the information in your account to falsified information. The reason for this is that many sites will retain information you previously had even after account deletion. The hope is that they will overwrite the previous information with the newest data you entered. However, there is no guarantee that there won't be backups with the prior information. For the account email, either create a new alternate email account via your provider of choice or create an alias using an email aliasing service . You can then delete your alternate email address once you are done. We recommend against using temporary email providers, as oftentimes it is possible to reactivate temporary emails. Delete \u00b6 You can check JustDeleteMe for instructions on deleting the account for a specific service. Some sites will graciously have a \"Delete Account\" option, while others will go as far as to force you to speak with a support agent. The deletion process can vary from site to site, with account deletion being impossible on some. For services that don't allow account deletion, the best thing to do is falsify all your information as previously mentioned and strengthen account security. To do so, enable MFA and any extra security features offered. As well, change the password to a randomly-generated one that is the maximum allowed size (a password manager can be useful for this). If you're satisfied that all information you care about is removed, you can safely forget about this account. If not, it might be a good idea to keep the credentials stored with your other passwords and occasionally re-login to reset the password. Even when you are able to delete an account, there is no guarantee that all your information will be removed. In fact, some companies are required by law to keep certain information, particularly when related to financial transactions. It's mostly out of your control what happens to your data when it comes to websites and cloud services. Avoid New Accounts \u00b6 As the old saying goes, \"an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.\" Whenever you feel tempted to sign up for a new account, ask yourself \"Do I really need this? Can I accomplish what I need to without an account?\" It can often be much harder to delete an account than to create one.

DNS translates domain names to IP addresses so browsers and other services can load Internet resources, through a decentralized network of servers. What is DNS ? \u00b6 When you visit a website, a numerical address is returned. For example, when you visit privacyguides.org , the address 192.98.54.105 is returned. DNS has existed since the early days of the Internet. DNS requests made to and from DNS servers are not generally encrypted. In a residential setting, a customer is given servers by the ISP via DHCP . Unencrypted DNS requests are able to be easily surveilled and modified in transit. In some parts of the world, ISPs are ordered to do primitive DNS filtering . When you request the IP address of a domain that is blocked, the server may not respond or may respond with a different IP address. As the DNS protocol is not encrypted, the ISP (or any network operator) can use DPI to monitor requests. ISPs can also block requests based on common characteristics, regardless of which DNS server is used. Unencrypted DNS always uses port 53 and always uses UDP . Below, we discuss and provide a tutorial to prove what an outside observer may see using regular unencrypted DNS and encrypted DNS . Unencrypted DNS \u00b6 Using tshark (part of the Wireshark project) we can monitor and record internet packet flow. This command records packets that meet the rules specified: tshark -w /tmp/dns.pcap udp port 53 and host 1 .1.1.1 or host 8 .8.8.8 We can then use dig (Linux, MacOS etc) or nslookup (Windows) to send the DNS lookup to both servers. Software such as web browsers do these lookups automatically, unless they are configured to use encrypted DNS .

Enterprise filtering and monitoring solutions (such as those purchased by governments) can do the process automatically, without human interaction, and can aggregate those frames to produce statistical data useful to the network observer.

What is \"encrypted DNS \"? \u00b6 Encrypted DNS can refer to one of a number of protocols, the most common ones being: DNSCrypt \u00b6 DNSCrypt was one of the first methods of encrypting DNS queries. DNSCrypt operates on port 443 and works with both the TCP or UDP transport protocols. DNSCrypt has never been submitted to the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) nor has it gone through the Request for Comments (RFC) process, so it has not been used widely outside of a few implementations . As a result, it has been largely replaced by the more popular DNS over HTTPS . DNS over TLS ( DoT ) \u00b6 DNS over TLS is another method for encrypting DNS communication that is defined in RFC 7858 . Support was first implemented in Android 9, iOS 14, and on Linux in systemd-resolved in version 237. Preference in the industry has been moving away from DoT to DoH in recent years, as DoT is a complex protocol and has varying compliance to the RFC across the implementations that exist. DoT also operates on a dedicated port 853 which can be blocked easily by restrictive firewalls. DNS over HTTPS ( DoH ) \u00b6 DNS over HTTPS as defined in RFC 8484 packages queries in the HTTP /2 protocol and provides security with HTTPS . Support was first added in web browsers such as Firefox 60 and Chrome 83. Native implementation of DoH showed up in iOS 14, macOS 11, Microsoft Windows, and Android 13 (however it won't be enabled by default ). General Linux desktop support is waiting on the systemd implementation so installing third party software is still required . What can an outside party see? \u00b6 In this example we will record what happens when we make a DoH request: First, start tshark : tshark -w /tmp/dns_doh.pcap -f \"tcp port https and host 1.1.1.1\" Second, make a request with curl : curl -vI --doh-url https://1.1.1.1/dns-query https://privacyguides.org After making the request, we can stop the packet capture with CTRL + C . Analyse the results in Wireshark: wireshark -r /tmp/dns_doh.pcap We can see the connection establishment and TLS handshake that occurs with any encrypted connection. When looking at the \"application data\" packets that follow, none of them contain the domain we requested or the IP address returned. Why shouldn't I use encrypted DNS ? \u00b6 In locations where there is internet filtering (or censorship), visiting forbidden resources may have its own consequences which you should consider in your threat model . We do not suggest the use of encrypted DNS for this purpose. Use Tor or a VPN instead. If you're using a VPN , you should use your VPN 's DNS servers. When using a VPN , you are already trusting them with all your network activity. When we do a DNS lookup, it's generally because we want to access a resource. Below, we will discuss some of the methods that may disclose your browsing activities even when using encrypted DNS : IP Address \u00b6 The simplest way to determine browsing activity might be to look at the IP addresses your devices are accessing. For example, if the observer knows that privacyguides.org is at 198.98.54.105 , and your device is requesting data from 198.98.54.105 , there is a good chance you're visiting Privacy Guides. This method is only useful when the IP address belongs to a server that only hosts few websites. It's also not very useful if the site is hosted on a shared platform, (e.g. Github Pages, Cloudflare Pages, Netlify, WordPress, Blogger, etc). It also isn't very useful if the server is hosted behind a reverse proxy , which is very common on the modern Internet. Server Name Indication ( SNI ) \u00b6 Server Name Indication is typically used when a IP address hosts many websites. This could be a service like Cloudflare, or some other Denial-of-service attack protection. Start capturing again with tshark . We've added a filter with our IP address so you don't capture many packets: tshark -w /tmp/pg.pcap port 443 and host 198 .98.54.105 Then we visit https://privacyguides.org . After visiting the website, we want to stop the packet capture with CTRL + C . Next we want to analyze the results: wireshark -r /tmp/pg.pcap We will see the connection establishment, followed by the TLS handshake for the Privacy Guides website. Around frame 5. you'll see a \"Client Hello\". Expand the triangle \u25b8 next to each field: \u25b8 Transport Layer Security \u25b8 TLSv1.3 Record Layer: Handshake Protocol: Client Hello \u25b8 Handshake Protocol: Client Hello \u25b8 Extension: server_name (len=22) \u25b8 Server Name Indication extension We can see the SNI value which discloses the website we are visiting. The tshark command can give you the value directly for all packets containing a SNI value: tshark -r /tmp/pg.pcap -Tfields -Y tls.handshake.extensions_server_name -e tls.handshake.extensions_server_name This means even if we are using \"Encrypted DNS \" servers, the domain will likely be disclosed through SNI . The TLS v1.3 protocol brings with it Encrypted Client Hello , which prevents this kind of leak. Governments, in particular China and Russia , have either already started blocking it or expressed a desire to do so. Recently, Russia has started blocking foreign websites that use the HTTP /3 standard. This is because the QUIC protocol that is a part of HTTP /3 requires that ClientHello also be encrypted. Online Certificate Status Protocol ( OCSP ) \u00b6 Another way your browser can disclose your browsing activities is with the Online Certificate Status Protocol . When visiting a HTTPS website, the browser might check to see if the website's certificate has been revoked. This is generally done through the HTTP protocol, meaning it is not encrypted. The OCSP request contains the certificate \" serial number \", which is unique. It is sent to the \" OCSP responder\" in order to check its status. We can simulate what a browser would do using the openssl command. Get the server certificate and use sed to keep just the important part and write it out to a file: openssl s_client -connect privacyguides.org:443 < /dev/null 2 > & 1 | sed -n '/^-*BEGIN/,/^-*END/p' > /tmp/pg_server.cert Get the intermediate certificate. Certificate Authorities (CA) normally don't sign a certificate directly; they use what is known as an \"intermediate\" certificate. openssl s_client -showcerts -connect privacyguides.org:443 < /dev/null 2 > & 1 | sed -n '/^-*BEGIN/,/^-*END/p' > /tmp/pg_and_intermediate.cert The first certificate in pg_and_intermediate.cert is actually the server certificate from step 1. We can use sed again to delete until the first instance of END: sed -n '/^-*END CERTIFICATE-*$/!d;:a n;p;ba' \\ /tmp/pg_and_intermediate.cert > /tmp/intermediate_chain.cert Get the OCSP responder for the server certificate: openssl x509 -noout -ocsp_uri -in /tmp/pg_server.cert Our certificate shows the Lets Encrypt certificate responder. If we want to see all the details of the certificate we can use: openssl x509 -text -noout -in /tmp/pg_server.cert Start the packet capture: tshark -w /tmp/pg_ocsp.pcap -f \"tcp port http\" Make the OCSP request: openssl ocsp -issuer /tmp/intermediate_chain.cert \\ -cert /tmp/pg_server.cert \\ -text \\ -url http://r3.o.lencr.org Open the capture: wireshark -r /tmp/pg_ocsp.pcap There will be two packets with the \" OCSP \" protocol; a \"Request\" and a \"Response\". For the \"Request\" we can see the \"serial number\" by expanding the triangle \u25b8 next to each field: \u25b8 Online Certificate Status Protocol \u25b8 tbsRequest \u25b8 requestList: 1 item \u25b8 Request \u25b8 reqCert serialNumber For the \"Response\" we can also see the \"serial number\": \u25b8 Online Certificate Status Protocol \u25b8 responseBytes \u25b8 BasicOCSPResponse \u25b8 tbsResponseData \u25b8 responses: 1 item \u25b8 SingleResponse \u25b8 certID serialNumber Or use tshark to filter the packets for the Serial Number: tshark -r /tmp/pg_ocsp.pcap -Tfields -Y ocsp.serialNumber -e ocsp.serialNumber If the network observer has the public certificate, which is publicly available, they can match the serial number with that certificate and therefore determine the site you're visiting from that. The process can be automated and can associate IP addresses with serial numbers. It is also possible to check Certificate Transparency logs for the serial number. Should I use encrypted DNS ? \u00b6 We made this flow chart to describe when you should use encrypted DNS : graph TB Start[Start] --> anonymous{Trying to be<br> anonymous?} anonymous--> | Yes | tor(Use Tor) anonymous --> | No | censorship{Avoiding<br> censorship?} censorship --> | Yes | vpnOrTor(Use<br> VPN or Tor) censorship --> | No | privacy{Want privacy<br> from ISP?} privacy --> | Yes | vpnOrTor privacy --> | No | obnoxious{ISP makes<br> obnoxious<br> redirects?} obnoxious --> | Yes | encryptedDNS(Use<br> encrypted DNS<br> with 3rd party) obnoxious --> | No | ispDNS{Does ISP support<br> encrypted DNS?} ispDNS --> | Yes | useISP(Use<br> encrypted DNS<br> with ISP) ispDNS --> | No | nothing(Do nothing) Encrypted DNS with a 3rd party should only be used to get around redirects and basic DNS blocking when you can be sure there won't be any consequences or you're interested in a provider that does some rudimentary filtering. List of recommended DNS servers What is DNSSEC ? \u00b6 Domain Name System Security Extensions ( DNSSEC ) is a feature of DNS that authenticates responses to domain name lookups. It does not provide privacy protections for those lookups, but rather prevents attackers from manipulating or poisoning the responses to DNS requests. In other words, DNSSEC digitally signs data to help ensure its validity. In order to ensure a secure lookup, the signing occurs at every level in the DNS lookup process. As a result, all answers from DNS can be trusted. The DNSSEC signing process is similar to someone signing a legal document with a pen; that person signs with a unique signature that no one else can create, and a court expert can look at that signature and verify that the document was signed by that person. These digital signatures ensure that data has not been tampered with. DNSSEC implements a hierarchical digital signing policy across all layers of DNS . For example, in the case of a privacyguides.org lookup, a root DNS server would sign a key for the .org nameserver, and the .org nameserver would then sign a key for privacyguides.org \u2019s authoritative nameserver. Adapted from DNS Security Extensions ( DNSSEC ) overview by Google and DNSSEC : An Introduction by Cloudflare, both licensed under CC BY 4.0 . What is QNAME minimization? \u00b6 A QNAME is a \"qualified name\", for example privacyguides.org . QNAME minimisation reduces the amount of information sent from the DNS server to the authoritative name server . Instead of sending the whole domain privacyguides.org , QNAME minimization means the DNS server will ask for all the records that end in .org . Further technical description is defined in RFC 7816 . What is EDNS Client Subnet ( ECS )? \u00b6 The EDNS Client Subnet is a method for a recursive DNS resolver to specify a subnetwork for the host or client which is making the DNS query. It's intended to \"speed up\" delivery of data by giving the client an answer that belongs to a server that is close to them such as a content delivery network , which are often used in video streaming and serving JavaScript web apps. This feature does come at a privacy cost, as it tells the DNS server some information about the client's location.","title":"Introduction to DNS"},{"location":"basics/dns/#what-is-dns","text":"When you visit a website, a numerical address is returned.

For example, if the observer knows that privacyguides.org is at 198.98.54.105 , and your device is requesting data from 198.98.54.105 , there is a good chance you're visiting Privacy Guides. This method is only useful when the IP address belongs to a server that only hosts few websites. It's also not very useful if the site is hosted on a shared platform, (e.g. Github Pages, Cloudflare Pages, Netlify, WordPress, Blogger, etc). It also isn't very useful if the server is hosted behind a reverse proxy , which is very common on the modern Internet.","title":"IP Address"},{"location":"basics/dns/#server-name-indication-sni","text":"Server Name Indication is typically used when a IP address hosts many websites. This could be a service like Cloudflare, or some other Denial-of-service attack protection. Start capturing again with tshark .

After visiting the website, we want to stop the packet capture with CTRL + C . Next we want to analyze the results: wireshark -r /tmp/pg.pcap We will see the connection establishment, followed by the TLS handshake for the Privacy Guides website.

The tshark command can give you the value directly for all packets containing a SNI value: tshark -r /tmp/pg.pcap -Tfields -Y tls.handshake.extensions_server_name -e tls.handshake.extensions_server_name This means even if we are using \"Encrypted DNS \" servers, the domain will likely be disclosed through SNI . The TLS v1.3 protocol brings with it Encrypted Client Hello , which prevents this kind of leak. Governments, in particular China and Russia , have either already started blocking it or expressed a desire to do so. Recently, Russia has started blocking foreign websites that use the HTTP /3 standard. This is because the QUIC protocol that is a part of HTTP /3 requires that ClientHello also be encrypted.","title":"Server Name Indication (SNI)"},{"location":"basics/dns/#online-certificate-status-protocol-ocsp","text":"Another way your browser can disclose your browsing activities is with the Online Certificate Status Protocol . When visiting a HTTPS website, the browser might check to see if the website's certificate has been revoked. This is generally done through the HTTP protocol, meaning it is not encrypted. The OCSP request contains the certificate \" serial number \", which is unique. It is sent to the \" OCSP responder\" in order to check its status.

It does not provide privacy protections for those lookups, but rather prevents attackers from manipulating or poisoning the responses to DNS requests. In other words, DNSSEC digitally signs data to help ensure its validity. In order to ensure a secure lookup, the signing occurs at every level in the DNS lookup process. As a result, all answers from DNS can be trusted. The DNSSEC signing process is similar to someone signing a legal document with a pen; that person signs with a unique signature that no one else can create, and a court expert can look at that signature and verify that the document was signed by that person. These digital signatures ensure that data has not been tampered with. DNSSEC implements a hierarchical digital signing policy across all layers of DNS . For example, in the case of a privacyguides.org lookup, a root DNS server would sign a key for the .org nameserver, and the .org nameserver would then sign a key for privacyguides.org \u2019s authoritative nameserver.

This feature does come at a privacy cost, as it tells the DNS server some information about the client's location.","title":"What is EDNS Client Subnet (ECS)?"},{"location":"basics/multi-factor-authentication/","text":"Multi-factor authentication is a security mechanism that requires additional steps beyond entering your username (or email) and password. The most common method is time limited codes you might receive from SMS or an app. Normally, if a hacker (or adversary) is able to figure out your password then they\u2019d gain access to the account that password belongs to. An account with MFA forces the hacker to have both the password (something you know ) and a device that you own (something you have ), like your phone. MFA methods vary in security, but are based on the premise that the more difficult it is for an attacker to gain access to your MFA method, the better. Examples of MFA methods (from weakest to strongest) include SMS , Email codes, app push notifications, TOTP , Yubico OTP , and FIDO . MFA Method Comparison \u00b6 SMS or Email MFA \u00b6 Receiving OTP codes via SMS or email are one of the weaker ways to secure your accounts with MFA . Obtaining a code by email or SMS takes away from the \"something you have \" idea, because there are a variety of ways a hacker could take over your phone number or gain access to your email without having physical access to any of your devices at all. If an unauthorized person gained access to your email, they would be able to use that access to both reset your password and receive the authentication code, giving them full access to your account. Push Notifications \u00b6 Push notification MFA takes the form of a message being sent to an app on your phone asking you to confirm new account logins. This method is a lot better than SMS or email, since an attacker typically wouldn't be able to get these push notifications without having an already logged-in device, which means they would need to compromise one of your other devices first. We all make mistakes, and there is the risk that you might accept the login attempt by accident. Push notification login authorizations are typically sent to all your devices at once, widening the availability of the MFA code if you have many devices. The security of push notification MFA is dependent on both the quality of the app, the server component and the trust of the developer who produces it. Installing an app may also require you to accept invasive privileges that grant access to other data on your device. An individual app also requires that you have a specific app for each service which may not require a password to open, unlike a good TOTP generator app. Time-based One-time Password ( TOTP ) \u00b6 TOTP is one of the most common forms of MFA available. When you set up TOTP you are generally required to scan a QR Code which establishes a \" shared secret \" with the service that you intend to use. The shared secret is secured inside of the authenticator app's data, and is sometimes protected by a password. The time-limited code is then derived from the shared secret and the current time. As the code is only valid for a short time, without access to the shared secret an adversary cannot generate new codes. If you have a hardware security key with TOTP support (such as a YubiKey with Yubico Authenticator ), we recommend that you store your \"shared secrets\" on the hardware. Hardware such as the YubiKey was developed with the intention of making the \"shared secret\" difficult to extract and copy. A YubiKey is also not connected to the Internet, unlike a phone with a TOTP app. Unlike WebAuthn , TOTP offers no protection against phishing or reuse attacks. If an adversary obtains a valid code from you they may use it as many times as they like until it expires (generally 60 seconds). An adversary could set up a website to imitate an official service in an attempt to trick you into giving out your username, password and current TOTP code. If the adversary then uses those recorded credentials they may be able to log into the real service and hijack the account. Although not perfect, TOTP is secure enough for most people, and when hardware security keys are not supported authenticator apps are still a good option. Hardware security keys \u00b6 The YubiKey stores data on a tamper-resistant solid-state chip which is impossible to access non-destructively without a expensive processes and a forensics laboratory. These keys are generally multi-function and provide a number of methods to authenticate. Below are the most common ones. Yubico OTP \u00b6 Yubico OTP is an authentication protocol typically implemented in hardware security keys. When you decide to use Yubico OTP , the key will generate a public ID, private ID, and a Secret Key which is then uploaded to the Yubico OTP server. When logging into a website, all you need to do is to physically touch the security key. The security key will emulate a keyboard and print out a one-time password into the password field. The service will then forward the one-time password to the Yubico OTP server for validation. A counter is incremented both on the key and Yubico's validation server. The OTP can only only be used once, and when a successful authentication occurs the counter is increased which prevents reuse of the OTP . Yubico provides a detailed document about the process. There are some benefits and disadvantages to using Yubico OTP when compared to TOTP . The Yubico validation server is a cloud based service, and you're placing trust in Yubico that they are storing data securely and not profiling you. The public ID associated with Yubico OTP is reused on every website and could be another avenue for third parties to profile you. Like TOTP , Yubico OTP does not provide phishing resistance. If your threat model requires you to have different identities on different websites, do not use Yubico OTP with the same hardware security key across those websites as public ID is unique to each security key. FIDO (Fast IDentity Online) \u00b6 FIDO includes a number of standards, first there was U2F and then later FIDO2 which includes the web standard WebAuthn . U2F and FIDO2 refer to the Client to Authenticator Protocol , which is the protocol between the security key and the computer, such as a laptop or phone. It complements WebAuthn which is the component used to authenticate with the website (the \"Relying Party\") you're trying to log in on. WebAuthn is the most secure and private form of second factor authentication. While the authentication experience is similar to Yubico OTP , the key does not print out a one-time password and validate with a third party server. Instead it uses public key cryptography for authentication. When you create an account the public key is sent to the service, then when you log in, the service will require you to \"sign\" some data with your private key. The benefit of this is that no password data is ever stored by the service, so there is nothing for an adversary to steal. This presentation discusses the history of password authentication, the pitfalls (such as password reuse), and discussion of FIDO2 and WebAuthn standards. FIDO2 and WebAuthn have superior security and privacy properties when compared to any MFA methods. Typically for web services it is used with WebAuthn which is a part of the W3C recommendations . It uses public key authentication and is more secure than shared secrets used in Yubico OTP and TOTP methods, as it includes the origin name (usually, the domain name) during authentication. Attestation is provided to protect you from phishing attacks, as it helps you to determine that you are using the authentic service and not a fake copy. Unlike Yubico OTP , WebAuthn does not use any public ID, so the key is not identifiable across different websites. It also does not use any third party cloud server for authentication. All communication is completed between the key and the website you are logging into. FIDO also uses a counter which is incremented upon use in order to prevent session reuse and cloned keys. If a website or service supports WebAuthn for the authentication, it is highly recommended that you use it over any other form of MFA . General Recommendations \u00b6 We have these general recommendations: Which Method Should I Use? \u00b6 When configuring your MFA method, keep in mind that it is only as secure as your weakest authentication method you use. This means it is important that you only use the best MFA method available. For instance, if you are already using TOTP , you should disable email and SMS MFA . If you are already using FIDO2/WebAuthn, you should not be using Yubico OTP or TOTP on your account. Backups \u00b6 You should always have backups for your MFA method. Hardware security keys can get lost, stolen, or simply stop working over time. It is recommended that you have a pair of hardware security keys with the same access to your accounts instead of just one. When using TOTP with an authenticator app, be sure to back up your recovery keys or the app itself, or copy the \"shared secrets\" to another instance of the app on a different phone or to an encrypted container (e.g VeraCrypt ). Initial Set Up \u00b6 When buying a security key, it is important that you change the default credentials, set up password protection for the key, and enable touch confirmation if your key supports it. Products such as the YubiKey) have multiple interfaces with separate credentials for each one of them, so you should go over each interface and set up protection as well. Email and SMS \u00b6 If you have to use email for MFA , make sure that the email account itself is secured with a proper MFA method. If you use SMS MFA , use a carrier who will not switch your phone number to a new SIM card without account access, or use a dedicated VoIP number from a provider with similar security to avoid a SIM swap attack . MFA tools we recommend More Places to Set Up MFA \u00b6 Beyond just securing your website logins, multi-factor authentication can be used to secure your local logins, SSH keys or even password databases as well. Windows \u00b6 Yubico has a dedicated Credential Provider that adds Challenge-Response authentication for the username + password login flow for local Windows accounts. If you have a YubiKey with Challenge-Response authentication support, take a look at the Yubico Login for Windows Configuration Guide , which will allow you to set up MFA on your Windows computer. macOS \u00b6 macOS has native support for authentication with smart cards (PIV). If you have a smartcard or a hardware security key that supports the PIV interface such as the YubiKey, we recommend that you follow your smartcard/hardware security vendor's documentation and set up second factor authentication for your macOS computer. Yubico have a guide Using Your YubiKey as a Smart Card in macOS which can help you set up your YubiKey on macOS. After your smartcard/security key is set up, we recommend running this command in the Terminal: sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow DisableFDEAutoLogin -bool YES The command will prevent an adversary from bypassing MFA when the computer boots. Linux \u00b6 Warning If the hostname of your system changes (such as due to DHCP), you would be unable to login. It is vital that you set up a proper hostname for your computer before following this guide. The pam_u2f module on Linux can provide two factor authentication for logging in on most popular Linux distributions. If you have a hardware security key that supports U2F , you can set up MFA authentication for your login. Yubico has a guide Ubuntu Linux Login Guide - U2F which should work on any distribution. The package manager commands\u2014such as apt-get \u2014and package names may however differ. This guide does not apply to Qubes OS . Qubes OS \u00b6 Qubes OS has support for Challenge-Response authentication with YubiKeys. If you have a YubiKey with Challenge-Response authentication support, take a look at the Qubes OS YubiKey documentation if you want to set up MFA on Qubes OS . SSH \u00b6 Hardware Security Keys \u00b6 SSH MFA could be set up using multiple different authentication methods that are popular with hardware security keys. We recommend that you check out Yubico's documentation on how to set this up. Time-based One-time Password ( TOTP ) \u00b6 SSH MFA can also be set up using TOTP . DigitalOcean has provided a tutorial How To Set Up Multi-Factor Authentication for SSH on Ubuntu 20.04 . Most things should be the same regardless of distribution, however the package manager commands\u2014such as apt-get \u2014and package names may differ. KeePass (and KeePassXC) \u00b6 KeePass and KeePassXC databases can be secured using Challenge-Response or HOTP as a second factor authentication. Yubico has provided a document for KeePass Using Your YubiKey with KeePass and there is also one on the KeePassXC website.","title":"Multi-factor Authentication"},{"location":"basics/multi-factor-authentication/#mfa-method-comparison","text":"","title":"MFA Method Comparison"},{"location":"basics/multi-factor-authentication/#sms-or-email-mfa","text":"Receiving OTP codes via SMS or email are one of the weaker ways to secure your accounts with MFA .

Everything is a trade-off: The more secure something is, the more restricting or inconvenient it generally is, et cetera. Often people find that the problem with the tools they see recommended is they're just too hard to start using! If you wanted to use the most secure tools available, you'd have to sacrifice a lot of usability. And even then, nothing is ever fully secure. There's high security, but never full security. That's why threat models are important. So, what are these threat models anyways? A threat model is a list of the most probable threats to your security/privacy endeavors. Since it's impossible to protect yourself against every attack(er), you should focus on the most probable threats. In computer security, a threat is a potential event that could undermine your efforts to stay private and secure. By focusing on the threats that matter to you, this narrows down your thinking about the protection you need, so you can choose the tools that are right for the job. Examples of threat models \u00b6 An investigative journalist's threat model might be (protecting themselves against) a foreign government. A company's manager's threat model might be (protecting themselves against) a hacker hired by competition to do corporate espionage. The average citizen's threat model might be (hiding their data from) large tech corporations. Creating your threat model \u00b6 To identify what could happen to the things you value and determine from whom you need to protect them, you want to answer these five questions: What do I want to protect? Who do I want to protect it from? How likely is it that I will need to protect it? How bad are the consequences if I fail? How much trouble am I willing to go through to try to prevent potential consequences? Example: Protecting your belongings \u00b6 To demonstrate how these questions work, let's build a plan to keep your house and possessions safe. What do you want to protect? (Or, what do you have that is worth protecting? ) \u00b6 Your assets might include jewelry, electronics, important documents, or photos. Who do you want to protect it from? \u00b6 Your adversaries might include burglars, roommates, or guests. How likely is it that you will need to protect it? \u00b6 Does your neighborhood have a history of burglaries? How trustworthy are your roommates/guests? What are the capabilities of your adversaries? What are the risks you should consider? How bad are the consequences if you fail? \u00b6 Do you have anything in your house that you cannot replace? Do you have the time or money to replace these things? Do you have insurance that covers goods stolen from your home? How much trouble are you willing to go through to prevent these consequences? \u00b6 Are you willing to buy a safe for sensitive documents? Can you afford to buy a high-quality lock? Do you have time to open a security box at your local bank and keep your valuables there? Only once you have asked yourself these questions will you be in a position to assess what measures to take. If your possessions are valuable, but the probability of a break-in is low, then you may not want to invest too much money in a lock. But, if the probability of a break-in is high, you'll want to get the best lock on the market, and consider adding a security system. Making a security plan will help you to understand the threats that are unique to you and to evaluate your assets, your adversaries, and your adversaries' capabilities, along with the likelihood of risks you face. Now, let's take a closer look at the questions in our list: What do I want to protect? \u00b6 An \u201casset\u201d is something you value and want to protect. In the context of digital security, an asset is usually some kind of information. For example, your emails, contact lists, instant messages, location, and files are all possible assets. Your devices themselves may also be assets. Make a list of your assets: data that you keep, where it's kept, who has access to it, and what stops others from accessing it. Who do I want to protect it from? \u00b6 To answer this question, it's important to identify who might want to target you or your information. A person or entity that poses a threat to your assets is an \u201cadversary.\u201d Examples of potential adversaries are your boss, your former partner, your business competition, your government, or a hacker on a public network. Make a list of your adversaries, or those who might want to get ahold of your assets. Your list may include individuals, a government agency, or corporations. Depending on who your adversaries are, under some circumstances this list might be something you want to destroy after you're done security planning. How likely is it that I will need to protect it? \u00b6 Risk is the likelihood that a particular threat against a particular asset will actually occur. It goes hand-in-hand with capability. While your mobile phone provider has the capability to access all of your data, the risk of them posting your private data online to harm your reputation is low. It is important to distinguish between what might happen and the probability it may happen. For instance, there is a threat that your building might collapse, but the risk of this happening is far greater in San Francisco (where earthquakes are common) than in Stockholm (where they are not). Assessing risks is both a personal and a subjective process. Many people find certain threats unacceptable no matter the likelihood they will occur because the mere presence of the threat at any likelihood is not worth the cost. In other cases, people disregard high risks because they don't view the threat as a problem. Write down which threats you are going to take seriously, and which may be too rare or too harmless (or too difficult to combat) to worry about. How bad are the consequences if I fail? \u00b6 There are many ways that an adversary could gain access to your data. For example, an adversary can read your private communications as they pass through the network, or they can delete or corrupt your data. The motives of adversaries differ widely, as do their tactics. A government trying to prevent the spread of a video showing police violence may be content to simply delete or reduce the availability of that video. In contrast, a political opponent may wish to gain access to secret content and publish that content without you knowing. Security planning involves understanding how bad the consequences could be if an adversary successfully gains access to one of your assets. To determine this, you should consider the capability of your adversary. For example, your mobile phone provider has access to all your phone records. A hacker on an open Wi-Fi network can access your unencrypted communications. Your government might have stronger capabilities. Write down what your adversary might want to do with your private data. How much trouble am I willing to go through to try to prevent potential consequences? \u00b6 There is no perfect option for security. Not everyone has the same priorities, concerns, or access to resources. Your risk assessment will allow you to plan the right strategy for you, balancing convenience, cost, and privacy. For example, an attorney representing a client in a national security case may be willing to go to greater lengths to protect communications about that case, such as using encrypted email, than a mother who regularly emails her daughter funny cat videos. Write down what options you have available to you to help mitigate your unique threats. Note if you have any financial constraints, technical constraints, or social constraints.

Link Tar \u00b6 The Linux \u201ctar\u201d stands for tape archive, which is used by a large number of Linux/Unix system administrators to deal with tape drives backup. Link xz \u00b6 xz is a new general-purpose, command line data compression utility, similar to gzip and bzip2. It can be used to compress or decompress a file according to the selected operation mode. It supports various formats to compress or decompress files. link Links \u00b6 Links are a very handy way to create a shortcut to an original directory. In Linux there are two different types of links: Hard links Symbolic links link Inode \u00b6 Linux must allocate an index node (inode) for every file and directory in the filesystem. Inodes do not store actual data. Instead, they store the metadata where you can find the storage blocks of each file\u2019s data. link Cut \u00b6 The cut command in UNIX is a command for cutting out the sections from each line of files and writing the result to standard output. It can be used to cut parts of a line by byte position, character and field. Display specific character: cut -c 8 test.txt Display range of characters: cut -c 4-8 test.txt Display 5 character to last character: cut -c 5- test.txt Display 1 to specified character: cut -c -3 test.txt Display 3 to 5 and 7 to 10 characters: cut -c 3-5,7-10 test.txt Display specific column data: -d -- delimiter ignore pipe symbol, by default TAB. -f -- field we get 3 column data. cut -d \"|\" -f 3 test.txt Display range of columns like 2 to 4: cut -d \"|\" -f 2-4 test.txt Display 2 to last column: cut -d \"|\" -f 2- text.txt Display 1 to specified column: cut -d \"|\" -f -3 text.txt Display 1,3,5 columns: cut -d \"|\" -f 1,3,5 text.txt Display all columns except 3 and 5: use --complement option cut -d \"|\" --complement -f 3,5 text.txt 3 to 5 columns: cut -d \"|\" --complement -f 3-5 text.txt Tr \u00b6 Stands for translate or delete. Search and replace a to A character: echo \"this is a line\" | tr 'a' 'A' echo \"this is a line\" | tr 'aeiou' 'AEIOU' Delete specified characters: echo \"this is a line\" | tr -d 'aeiou' Remove repeated characters in word: echo \"thiiis iis aaa linee\" | tr -s 'aeiou' Regular Expressions \u00b6 By using wild card characters, we can build regular expressions. \"*\" --> represents zero or more characters, i.e any number of characters. \"?\" --> represents only one character \"[]\" --> range of characters \"[abc]\" --> a or b or c (we have to take only one character a or b or c) \"[!abc]\" --> except a,b,c. any character \"[a-z]\" --> any lower case alphabet symbol \"[A-Z]\" --> any upper case alphabet symbol \"[a-zA-z]\" --> any alphabet symbol either lower or upper \"[0-9]\" --> any digit 0 to 9 \"[a-zA-z0-9]\" --> any alphanumeric character \"[!a-zA-z0-9]\" --> Except any alphanumeric character (special symbol) \"[[:lower:]]\" --> Any lower case alphabet symbol \"[[:upper:]]\" --> Any upper case alphabet symbol \"[[:alpha:]]\" --> Any alphabet symbol \"[[:digit:]]\" --> Any digit from 0 to 9 \"[[:alnum:]]\" --> This is the same as \u2018[0-9A-Za-z]\u2019 \"[![:digit:]]\" --> Any character except digit \"{ }\" --> List of files with comma seperator. \"{a..z}\" --> a to z files touch {a..d}.java --> create a,b,c,d files To list out all files where file name starts with a or b or c ls [a-c]* --> a.txt, b.txt, c.java List first one uppercase alpha, second digit, third lowercase alpha ls [[:upper:]][[:digit:]][[:lower:]] --> A7b W4u Z6k List all files starts with special symbol ls [![:alnum:]]* --> %abc.txt List all files .java or .py extension ls {*.java,*.py} --> b.java, c.java, j.py, k.py Remove all files start with a or b or c and ends with e or t rm [abc]*[et] --> a.txt and b.txt will be removed List files begin with upper and has letter d in 3rd char, ends with lowercase [[:upper:]]?d*[[:lower]] Password authentication \u00b6 Password authentication for aws instance not keybased vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config PasswordAuthentication yes systemctl restart sshd visudo for sudo access in /etc/sudoers file without password username All=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL To check memory: free - h /etc/hosts \u00b6 All operating systems with network support have a hosts file to translate hostnames to IP addresses. Whenever you open a website by typing its hostname, your system will read through the hosts file to check for the corresponding IP and then open it. The hosts file is a simple text file located in the etc folder on Linux and Mac OS (/etc/hosts). Whenever you type an address, your system will check the hosts file for its presence; if it is present there, you will be directed to the corresponding IP. If the hostname is not defined in the hosts file, your system will check the DNS server of your internet to look up for the corresponding IP and redirect you accordingly. Why Edit /etc/hosts file? By editing the hosts files, you can achieve the following things: Block a website: You can block a website by redirecting it to the IP of your localhost or the default route. For example, if we want to block google.com, we can add the following text to our file: 127.0.0.1 www.google.com or 0.0.0.0 www.google.com Now when you try to open www.google.com from your browser, you will see an error. Access Remote Computer Through an Alias: Suppose we have a server located at a local network that we want to access. We usually have to type the server\u2019s IP to access it unless it has been defined on our local DNS. One way to avoid typing the IP, again and again, is to assign an alias to the server in the hosts file as follows: 192.168.1.10 myserver The IP corresponds to the location of the server we want to access and myserver is the new alias we want to use. Sometimes you may need to restart the web browser to apply changes. Findmnt \u00b6 The more common command to check mounted file systems on linux is the mount command which is used to not only list mounted devices, but also mount and unmount them as and when needed. The findmnt command shows details like the device name, mount directory, mount options and the file system type. List the file systems: findmnt Output in list format: findmnt - l df style output: findmnt - D Read file systems from fstab: findmnt - s Filter filesystems by type: findmnt - t ext4 Search by source device: findmnt -S /dev/sda1 Search by mount point: findmnt -T / To run previous command: !f To list environment variables: env Grep \u00b6 The grep filter searches a file for a particular pattern of characters, and displays all lines that contain that pattern. The pattern that is searched in the file is referred to as the regular expression (grep stands for global search for regular expression and print out). Search any line that contains the word in filename on Linux: grep 'word' filename Perform a case-insensitive search for the word \u2018bar\u2019 in Linux and Unix: grep -i 'bar' file1 Look for all files in the current directory and in all of its subdirectories in Linux for the word \u2018httpd\u2019: grep -R 'httpd' . Search and display the total number of times that the string \u2018nixcraft\u2019 appears in a file named frontpage.md: grep -c 'nixcraft' frontpage.md Use grep to search words only: You can force the grep command to select only those lines containing matches that form whole words grep -w \"boo\" file Output with the number of the line in the text file: grep -n 'root' /etc/passwd Force grep invert match: For example print all line that do not contain the word start root grep -v '^root' /etc/passwd Display lines before and after the match: Want to see the lines before your matches grep -B 3 'root' /etc/passwd display the lines after your matches grep -A 3 'root' /etc/passwd prints the searched line and 3 lines after and before the result grep -C 3 'root' /etc/passwd Display the file names that matches the pattern: grep -l \"unix\" * Displaying only the matched pattern: By default, grep displays the entire line which has the matched string. We can make the grep to display only the matched string by using the -o option. grep -o \"unix\" geekfile.txt Matching the lines that start with a string: The ^ regular expression pattern specifies the start of a line. grep \"^unix\" geekfile.txt Matching the lines that end with a string: The $ regular expression pattern specifies the end of a line. grep \"os$\" geekfile.txt Specifies multiple contents with -e option: grep \u2013e \"Agarwal\" \u2013e \"divi\" \u2013e \"jesh\" geekfile.txt Takes patterns from file, one per line using option -f: grep \u2013f pattern.txt geekfile.txt To search for string in directory recursive ignore errors: sudo grep - R anon / etc / 2 > / dev / null To find files: sudo grep - Rl anon / etc / 2 > / dev / null Egrep \u00b6 The egrep command searches for a text pattern, using extended regular expressions to perform the match. Running egrep is equivalent to running grep with the -E option. Grep can understand some patterns but not all patterns. Display all lines start with 'D' grep '^D' text Display all lines end with 'D' grep 'D$' text Search for vowels in file grep '[aeiou]' text Search for other than vowels in file grep '[^aeiou]' text Search for multiple patterns grep -e 'hyd' -e 'ban' text or egrep '(hyd|ban)' text Fgrep \u00b6 Fixed strings grep cannot understand patterns, it can understand only strings. To search fast we use grep and performance wise. grep -F Some words are there in file.txt search those in demo.txt. fgrep -f file.txt demo.txt Shuffling \u00b6 shuf -i 1-100 -n 1 8 touch pot/dir$(shuf -i 1-100 -n 1)/divi.txt find pot -type f -name 'divi.txt' move find result to desktop find pot -type f -name 'divi.txt' -exec mv {} ~/Desktop \\; Remove all files in pot but not dirs find pot -type f -name '*.txt' -exec rm {} \\;","title":"Tritree"},{"location":"linux/rhcsa/#rhcsa-notes","text":"","title":"RHCSA Notes"},{"location":"linux/rhcsa/#which","text":"which command in Linux is a command which is used to locate the executable file associated with the given command by searching it in the path environment variable.

This tutor is designed to describe enough of the commands that you will be able to easily use Vim as an all-purpose editor. Exiting Vim \u00b6 Press the Esc key (to make sure you are in Normal mode). Type :q! Enter This exits the editor, DISCARDING any changes you have made. Text Editing - Deletion \u00b6 Press x to delete the character under the cursor. Text Editing - Insertion \u00b6 Press i to insert text. Text Editing - Appending \u00b6 Press A to append text. It moves to end of line in insert mode. Save and Quit \u00b6 Use :wq to save a file and exit. Deletion Commands \u00b6 Type dw to delete a word. Type d$ to delete to the end of the line. Operators and Motion \u00b6 Many commands that change text are made from an operator and a motion. The format for a delete command with the d delete operator is as follows: d and motion d - is the delete operator. motion - is what the operator will operate on (listed below). A short list of motions: w - until the start of the next word, EXCLUDING its first character. e - to the end of the current word, INCLUDING the last character. $ - to the end of the line, INCLUDING the last character. de - will delete from the cursor to the end of the word. Using a Count for Motion: Typing a number before a motion repeats it that many times. 2w to move the cursor two words forward. 3e to move the cursor to the end of the third word forward. 0 (zero) to move to the start of the line. Using a Count to Delete More: Typing a number with an operator repeats it that many times. d number motion Type d2w or 2dw to delete two words. Operating on Line: Type dd to delete a whole line. Type 2dd to delete two lines. Undo \u00b6 Press u to undo the last commands, U to fix a whole line. Now type CTRL-R (keeping CTRL key pressed while hitting R) a few times to redo the commands (undo the undo's). Delete Summary \u00b6 To delete from the cursor up to the next word type: dw To delete from the cursor up to the end of the word type: de To delete from the cursor to the end of a line type: d$ To delete a whole line type: dd Put Command \u00b6 Type dd to delete the line and store it in a Vim register. Type p to put previously deleted text after the cursor. Replace Command \u00b6 Type rx to replace the character at the cursor with x . Another way to replace Type a capital R to replace more than one character. Replace mode is like Insert mode, but every typed character deletes an existing character. Change Operator \u00b6 To change until the end of a word, type ce . Type ce and the correct word. cc does the same for the whole line. The change operator works in the same way as delete. The format is: c [number] motion The motions are the same, such as w (word) and $ (end of line). Cursor Location and File Status \u00b6 Type CTRL-G to show your location in the file and the file status. Press G to move you to the bottom of the file. Type gg to move you to the start of the file. Type the number of the line you were on and then G, ex. 34G Search Command \u00b6 Type / followed by a phrase to search for the phrase. To search for the same phrase again, simply type n . To search for the same phrase in the opposite direction, type N . To search for a phrase in the backward direction, use ? instead of / . To go back to where you came from press CTRL-O (Keep Ctrl down while pressing the letter o). Repeat to go back further. CTRL-I goes forward. Matching Parentheses Search \u00b6 Type % to find a matching ),], or } . The cursor will move to the matching parenthesis or bracket. Substitute Command \u00b6 Type :s/old/new/g to substitute 'new' for 'old'. Type :s/thee/the Enter . Note that this command only changes the first occurrence of \"thee\" in the line. Now type :s/thee/the/g . Adding the g flag means to substitute globally in the line, change all occurrences of \"thee\" in the line. To change every occurrence of a character string between two lines, Type :#,#s/old/new/g where #,# are the line numbers of the range of lines where the substitution is to be done. Type :%s/old/new/g to change every occurrence in the whole file. Type :%s/old/new/gc to find every occurrence in the whole file, with a prompt whether to substitute or not. Execute External Command \u00b6 Type :! followed by an external command to execute that command. :!ls :!pwd for example. Writing Files \u00b6 To save the changes made to the text, type :w FILENAME Now remove the file by typing (Windows) :!del TEST or (Unix): :!rm TEST Selecting Text to Write \u00b6 To save part of the file, type v motion :w FILENAME Press v and move the cursor to the fifth item below. Notice that the text is highlighted. Press the : character. At the bottom of the screen :'<,'> will appear. Type w TEST , where TEST is a filename that does not exist yet. Verify that you see :'<,'>w TEST before you press Enter Retrieving and Merging Files \u00b6 To insert the contents of a file, type :r FILENAME You can also read the output of an external command. For example, :r !ls reads the output of the ls command and puts it below the cursor. :r FILENAME retrieves disk file FILENAME and puts it below the cursor position. :r !dir reads the output of the dir command and puts it below the cursor position. Open Command \u00b6 Type o to open a line below the cursor and place you in Insert mode. To open up a line ABOVE the cursor, simply type a capital O Append Command \u00b6 Type a to insert text AFTER the cursor. Use e to move to the next incomplete word. a, i and A all go to the same Insert mode, the only difference is where the characters are inserted. Copy and Paste \u00b6 Use the y operator to copy text and p to paste it. You can also use y as an operator: yw yanks one word, yy yanks the whole line, then p puts that line. Set Option \u00b6 Set an option so a search or substitute ignores case. Typing \":set xxx\" sets the option \"xxx\". Some options are: 'ic' 'ignorecase' ignore upper/lower case when searching 'is' 'incsearch' show partial matches for a search phrase 'hls' 'hlsearch' highlight all matching phrases, You can either use the long or the short option name. Prepend \"no\" to switch an option off. :set noic Getting Help \u00b6 :help w :help c_CTRL-D :help insert-index :help user-manual Type CTRL-W CTRL-W to jump from one window to another. Type :q Enter to close the help window. Completion \u00b6 Command line completion with CTRL-D and Tab Type the start of a command :e CTRL-D and Vim will show a list of commands that start with \"e\". Comment multiple lines \u00b6 Press the Ctrl + V keys to enable visual mode. Select all the lines you wish to comment out. With the target lines selected, press Shift + I to enter insert mode. We need to insert the pound (#) symbol. Finally, press the ESC key, and Vim will comment out all the selected lines.

We cover some general techniques here. Firewalls \u00b6 A firewall may be used to secure connections to your system. If you\u2019re on a public network, the necessity of this may be greater than if you\u2019re on a local trusted network that you control. We would generally recommend that you block incoming connections only, unless you\u2019re using an application firewall such as OpenSnitch or Portmaster . Red Hat distributions (such as Fedora) are typically configured through firewalld . Red Hat has plenty of documentation regarding this topic. There is also the Uncomplicated Firewall which can be used as an alternative. Consider blocking all ports which are not well known or \u201cprivileged ports\u201d. That is, ports from 1025 up to 65535. Block both TCP and UDP after the operating system is installed. If you use Fedora, consider removing the whitelist for for smb -client and mdns services if you do not use them. All these firewalls use the Netfilter framework and therefore cannot protect against malicious programs running on the system. A malicious program could insert its own rules. If you are using Flatpak packages, you can revoke their network socket access using Flatseal and prevent those applications from accessing your network. This permission is not bypassable. If you are using non-classic Snap packages on a system with proper snap confinement support (with both AppArmor and cgroups v1 present), you can use the Snap Store to revoke network permission as well. This is also not bypassable. Kernel hardening \u00b6 There are some additional kernel hardening options such as configuring sysctl keys and kernel command-line parameters which are described in the following pages. We don\u2019t recommend you change these options unless you learn about what they do. Recommended sysctl settings Recommended boot parameters Additional recommendations to reduce the kernel's attack surface Note that setting kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone=0 will stop Flatpak, Snap (that depend on browser-sandbox), Electron based AppImages, Podman, Docker, and LXC containers from working. Do not set this flag if you are using container products. Linux-Hardened \u00b6 Some distributions like Arch Linux have the linux-hardened , kernel package. It includes hardening patches and more security-conscious defaults. Linux-Hardened has kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone=0 disabled by default. See the warning above about how this might impact you. Simultaneous multithreading (SMT) \u00b6 SMT has been the cause of numerous hardware vulnerabilities, and subsequent patches for those vulnerabilities often come with performance penalties that negate most of the performance gain given by SMT. If you followed the \u201ckernel hardening\u201d section above, some kernel parameters already disable SMT. If the option is available to you, we recommend that you disable it in your firmware as well. Hardened memory allocator \u00b6 The hardened memory allocator from GrapheneOS can be used on Linux distributions. It is available by default on Whonix and is available as an AUR package on Arch based distributions. If you are using the AUR package, consider setting up LD_PRELOAD as described in the Arch Wiki . Umask \u00b6 If you are not using openSUSE, consider changing the default umask for both regular user accounts and root to 077. Changing umask to 077 can break snapper on openSUSE and is not recommended. Mountpoint hardening \u00b6 Consider adding the following options nodev , noexec , and nosuid to mountpoints which do not need them. Typically, these could be applied to /boot , /boot/efi , /home , /root , and /var . If you use Toolbox , /var/log/journal must not have any of those options. If you are on Arch Linux, do not apply noexec to /var/tmp . Linux Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) \u00b6 There is also further hardening to PAM to secure authentication to your system. This guide has some tips on this. On Red Hat distributions you can use authselect to configure this e.g.: sudo authselect select <profile_id, default: sssd> with-faillock without-nullok with-pamaccess On systems where pam_faillock is not available, consider using pam_tally2 instead. USB port protection \u00b6 To better protect your USB ports from attacks such as BadUSB we recommend USBGuard . USBGuard has documentation as does the Arch Wiki . Another alternative option if you\u2019re using the linux-hardened is the deny_new_usb sysctl. See Preventing USB Attacks with linux-hardened . Secure Boot \u00b6 Secure Boot can be used to secure the boot process by preventing the loading of unsigned UEFI drivers or boot loaders . Some guidance for this is provided in this physical security guide and this verified boot guide . For further resources on Secure Boot we suggest taking a look at the following for instructional advice: The Archwiki\u2019s Secure Boot article. There are two main methods, the first is to use a shim , the second more complete way is to use your own keys . For background of how Secure Boot works on Linux: The Strange State of Authenticated Boot and Disk Encryption on Generic Linux Distributions Rod Smith\u2019s Managing EFI Boot Loaders for Linux Dealing with Secure Boot Controlling Secure Boot One of the problems with Secure Boot particularly on Linux is that only the chainloader (shim), the boot loader (GRUB), and the kernel are verified and that\u2019s where verification stops. The initramfs is often left unverified, unencrypted, and open up the window for an evil maid attack. There are a few things that can be done to reduce risk such as: Creating an EFI Boot Stub that contains the kernel , initramfs and microcode . This EFI stub can then be signed. If you use dracut this can easily be done with the --uefi-stub switch or the uefi_stub config option. Encrypting the boot partition . However, this has its own issues, the first being that GRUB only supports LUKS1 and not the newer default LUKS2 scheme. As the bootloader runs in protected mode and the encryption module lacks SSE acceleration the boot process will take minutes to complete. Using TPM to perform a measured boot . After setting up Secure Boot it is crucial that you set a \u201cfirmware password\u201d (also called a \u201csupervisor password, \u201cBIOS password\u201d or \u201cUEFI password\u201d), otherwise an adversary can simply disable Secure Boot.

Red Hat distributions (such as Fedora) are typically configured through firewalld . Red Hat has plenty of documentation regarding this topic.

Other operating systems which also use the Linux kernel such as ChromeOS, Android, and Qubes OS are not discussed here. Our Linux Recommendations Release cycle \u00b6 We highly recommend that you choose distributions which stay close to the stable upstream software releases, often referred to as rolling release distributions. This is because frozen release cycle distributions often don\u2019t update package versions and fall behind on security updates. For frozen distributions, package maintainers are expected to backport patches to fix vulnerabilities (Debian is one such example ) rather than bump the software to the \u201cnext version\u201d released by the upstream developer. Some security fixes do not receive a CVE (particularly less popular software) at all and therefore do not make it into the distribution with this patching model. As a result minor security fixes are sometimes held back until the next major release. We don\u2019t believe holding packages back and applying interim patches is a good idea, as it diverges from the way the developer might have intended the software to work. Richard Brown has a presentation about this: Traditional vs Atomic updates \u00b6 Traditionally, Linux distributions update by sequentially updating the desired packages. Traditional updates such as those used in Fedora, Arch Linux, and Debian based distributions can be less reliable if an error occurs while updating. Atomic updating distributions apply updates in full or not at all. Typically, transactional update systems are also atomic. A transactional update system creates a snapshot that is made before and after an update is applied. If an update fails at any time (perhaps due to a power failure), the update can be easily rolled back to a \u201clast known good state\u201d. The Atomic update method is used for immutable distributions like Silverblue, Tumbleweed, and NixOS and can achieve reliability with this model. Adam \u0160amal\u00edk provided a presentation on how rpm-ostree works with Silverblue: \u201cSecurity-focused\u201d distributions \u00b6 There is often some confusion about \u201csecurity-focused\u201d distributions and \u201cpentesting\u201d distributions. A quick search for \u201cthe most secure Linux distribution\u201d will often give results like Kali Linux, Black Arch, and Parrot OS . These distributions are offensive penetration testing distributions that bundle tools for testing other systems. They don\u2019t include any \u201cextra security\u201d or defensive mitigations intended for regular use. Arch-based distributions \u00b6 Arch based distributions are not recommended for those new to Linux, regardless of the distribution. Arch does not have an distribution update mechanism for the underlying software choices. As a result you have to stay aware with current trends and adopt technologies as they supersede older practices on your own. For a secure system, you are also expected to have sufficient Linux knowledge to properly set up security for their system such as adopting a mandatory access control system, setting up kernel module blacklists, hardening boot parameters, manipulating sysctl parameters, and knowing what components they need such as Polkit . Anyone using the Arch User Repository (AUR) , must be comfortable in auditing PKGBUILDs that they install from that service. AUR packages are community-produced content and are not vetted in any way, and therefore are vulnerable to software supply chain attacks, which has in fact happened in the past . AUR should always be used sparingly and often there is a lot of bad advice on various pages which direct people to blindly use AUR helpers without sufficient warning. Similar warnings apply to using third party Personal Package Archives (PPAs) on Debian based distributions or Community Projects (COPR) on Fedora. If you are experienced with Linux and wish to use an Arch-based distribution, we only recommend Arch Linux proper, not any of its derivatives. We recommend against these two Arch derivatives specifically: Manjaro : This distribution holds packages back for 2 weeks to make sure that their own changes don\u2019t break, not to make sure that upstream is stable. When AUR packages are used, they are often built against the latest libraries from Arch\u2019s repositories. Garuda : They use Chaotic-AUR which automatically and blindly compiles packages from the AUR. There is no verification process to make sure that the AUR packages don\u2019t suffer from supply chain attacks.

Applications installed from the package manager ( dnf , apt , etc.) typically have no sandboxing or confinement whatsoever. Below are a few projects that aim to solve this problem: Flatpak \u00b6 Flatpak aims to be a universal package manager for Linux. One of its main goals is to provide a universal package format which can be used in most Linux distributions. It provides some permission control . It has been pointed out that Flatpak sandboxing could be improved as particular Flatpaks often have greater permission than required. There does seem to be some agreement that this is the case. You can restrict applications further by issuing Flatpak overrides . This can be done with the command-line or by using Flatseal . Some sample overrides are provided by tommytran732 and rusty-snake . We generally recommend revoking access to: the Network ( share=network ) socket (internet access) the PulseAudio socket (for both audio in and out), device=all (access to all devices including the camera) org.freedesktop.secrets dbus (access to secrets stored on your keychain) for applications which do not need it If an application works natively with Wayland (and not running through the XWayland compatibility layer), consider revoking its access to the X11 ( socket=x11 ) and Inter-process communications (IPC) socket ( share=ipc ) as well. We also recommend restricting broad filesystem permissions such as filesystem=home and filesystem=host which should be revoked and replaced with just the directories that the app needs to access. Some applications like VLC implement the Portals API , which allows a file manager to pass files to the Flatpak application (e.g. VLC) without specific filesystem access privileges. VLC is only able to access the specific file that you want to open, rather than requiring privileges to particular locations. Hard-coded access to some kernel interfaces like /sys and /proc and weak seccomp filters unfortunately cannot be secured with Flatpak. Firejail \u00b6 Firejail is another method of sandboxing. As it is a large setuid binary, it has a large attack surface which may assist in privilege escalation . This post from a Whonix security researcher provides additional details on how Firejail can worsen the security of your device. Mandatory Access Control \u00b6 Mandatory access control systems require policy files in order to force constraints on the system. The two main control systems are SELinux (used on Android and Fedora) and AppArmor . Fedora includes SELinux preconfigured with some policies that will confine system daemons (background processes). We don\u2019t recommend disabling SELinux . openSUSE gives the choice of AppArmor or SELinux during the installation process. We recommend sticking to the default for each variant (AppArmor for Tumbleweed and SELinux for MicroOS ). openSUSE\u2019s SELinux policies are derived from Fedora. Arch and Arch-based operating systems often do not come with a mandatory access control system and that must be configured manually for either AppArmor or SELinux . Linux desktops don't usually include individual app confinement rules, unlike Android which sandboxes every application installed. Making your own policies/profiles \u00b6 You can make your own AppArmor profiles, SELinux policies, Bubblewrap profiles, and seccomp blacklist to have better confinement of applications. This is an advanced and sometimes tedious task, so we won\u2019t go into detail about how to do it here, but we do have a few projects that you could use as reference. Whonix\u2019s AppArmor Everything Krathalan\u2019s AppArmor profiles noatsecure\u2019s SELinux templates Seirdy\u2019s Bubblewrap scripts Securing Linux containers \u00b6 If you\u2019re running a server you may have heard of Linux Containers, Docker, or Podman which refer to a kind of OS -level virtualization . Containers are more common in server and development environments where individual apps are built to operate independently. Docker is one of the most common container solutions. It does not run a proper sandbox, and this means that there is a large kernel attack surface . The daemon controls everything and typically runs as root. If it crashes for some reason, all the containers will crash too. The gVisor runtime which implements an application level kernel can help limit the number of syscalls an application can make and can help isolate it from the host\u2019s kernel . Red Hat develops Podman and secures it with SELinux to isolate containers from each other. One of the notable differences between Docker and Podman is that Docker requires root while Podman can run with rootless containers that are also daemonless , meaning if one crashes they don\u2019t all come down. Another option is Kata containers , where virtual machines masquerade as containers. Each Kata container has its own Linux kernel and is isolated from the host.

The Linux command line is provided by a program called the shell. Various options for the shell program have been developed over the years, and different users can be configured to use different shells. Most users, however, stick with the current default. The default shell for users in Red Hat Enterprise Linux is the GNU Bourne-Again Shell (bash) . Bash is an improved version of one of the most successful shells used on UNIX-like systems, the Bourne Shell (sh) . When a shell is used interactively, it displays a string when it is waiting for a command from the user. This is called the shell prompt. When a regular user starts a shell, the default prompt ends with a $ character, as shown below. [ user@host ~ ] $ The $ character is replaced by a # character if the shell is running as the superuser, root. This makes it more obvious that it is a superuser shell, which helps to avoid accidents and mistakes which can affect the whole system. The superuser shell prompt is shown below. [ root@host ~ ] # Using bash to execute commands can be powerful. The bash shell provides a scripting language that can support automation of tasks. The shell has additional capabilities that can simplify or make possible operations that are hard to accomplish efficiently with graphical tools. NOTE The bash shell is similar in concept to the command-line interpreter found in recent versions of Microsoft Windows, cmd.exe, although bash has a more sophisticated scripting language. It is also similar to Windows PowerShell in Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 and later. Administrators using the Apple Mac who use the Terminal utility may be pleased to note that bash is the default shell in macOS. SHELL BASICS \u00b6 Commands entered at the shell prompt have three basic parts: Command to run Options to adjust the behavior of the command Arguments, which are typically targets of the command The command is the name of the program to run. It may be followed by one or more options, which adjust the behavior of the command or what it will do. Options normally start with one or two dashes (-a or --all, for example) to distinguish them from arguments. Commands may also be followed by one or more arguments, which often indicate a target that the command should operate upon. For example, the command usermod -L user01 has a command (usermod), an option (-L), and an argument (user01). The effect of this command is to lock the password of the user01 user account. LOGGING IN TO A LOCAL COMPUTER \u00b6 To run the shell, you need to log in to the computer on a terminal. A terminal is a text-based interface used to enter commands into and print output from a computer system. There are several ways to do this. The computer might have a hardware keyboard and display for input and output directly connected to it. This is the Linux machine's physical console. The physical console supports multiple virtual consoles, which can run separate terminals. Each virtual console supports an independent login session. You can switch between them by pressing Ctrl+Alt and a function key (F1 through F6) at the same time. Most of these virtual consoles run a terminal providing a text login prompt, and if you enter your username and password correctly, you will log in and get a shell prompt. The computer might provide a graphical login prompt on one of the virtual consoles. You can use this to log in to a graphical environment. The graphical environment also runs on a virtual console. To get a shell prompt you must start a terminal program in the graphical environment. The shell prompt is provided in an application window of your graphical terminal program. NOTE Many system administrators choose not to run a graphical environment on their servers. This allows resources which would be used by the graphical environment to be used by the server's services instead. In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8, if the graphical environment is available, the login screen will run on the first virtual console, called tty1 . Five additional text login prompts are available on virtual consoles two through six. If you log in using the graphical login screen, your graphical environment will start on the first virtual console that is not currently being used by a login session. Normally, your graphical session will replace the login prompt on the second virtual console ( tty2 ). However, if that console is in use by an active text login session (not just a login prompt), the next free virtual console is used instead. The graphical login screen continues to run on the first virtual console ( tty1 ). If you are already logged in to a graphical session, and log in as another user on the graphical login screen or use the Switch User menu item to switch users in the graphical environment without logging out, another graphical environment will be started for that user on the next free virtual console. When you log out of a graphical environment, it will exit and the physical console will automatically switch back to the graphical login screen on the first virtual console. NOTE In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7, the graphical login screen runs on the first virtual console, but when you log in your initial graphical environment replaces the login screen on the first virtual console instead of starting on a new virtual console. In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and earlier, the first six virtual consoles always provided text login prompts. If the graphical environment is running, it is on virtual console seven (accessed through Ctrl+Alt+F7 ). A headless server does not have a keyboard and display permanently connected to it. A data center may be filled with many racks of headless servers, and not providing each with a keyboard and display saves space and expense. To allow administrators to log in, a headless server might have a login prompt provided by its serial console, running on a serial port which is connected to a networked console server for remote access to the serial console. The serial console would normally be used to fix the server if its own network card became misconfigured and logging in over its own network connection became impossible. Most of the time, however, headless servers are accessed by other means over the network. LOGGING IN OVER THE NETWORK \u00b6 Linux users and administrators often need to get shell access to a remote system by connecting to it over the network. In a modern computing environment, many headless servers are actually virtual machines or are running as public or private cloud instances. These systems are not physical and do not have real hardware consoles. They might not even provide access to their (simulated) physical console or serial console. In Linux, the most common way to get a shell prompt on a remote system is to use Secure Shell (SSH). Most Linux systems (including Red Hat Enterprise Linux) and macOS provide the OpenSSH command-line program ssh for this purpose. In this example, a user with a shell prompt on the machine host uses ssh to log in to the remote Linux system remotehost as the user remoteuser: [ user@host ~ ] $ ssh remoteuser@remotehost remoteuser@remotehost ' s password: password [ remoteuser@remotehost ~ ] $ The ssh command encrypts the connection to secure the communication against eavesdropping or hijacking of the passwords and content. Some systems (such as new cloud instances) do not allow users to use a password to log in with ssh for tighter security. An alternative way to authenticate to a remote machine without entering a password is through public key authentication . With this authentication method, users have a special identity file containing a private key, which is equivalent to a password, and which they keep secret. Their account on the server is configured with a matching public key, which does not have to be secret. When logging in, users can configure ssh to provide the private key and if their matching public key is installed in that account on that remote server, it will log them in without asking for a password. In the next example, a user with a shell prompt on the machine host logs in to remotehost as remoteuser using ssh , using public key authentication. The -i option is used to specify the user's private key file, which is mylab.pem. The matching public key is already set up as an authorized key in the remoteuser account. [ user@host ~ ] $ ssh -i mylab.pem remoteuser@remotehost [ remoteuser@remotehost ~ ] $ For this to work, the private key file must be readable only by the user that owns the file. In the preceding example, where the private key is in the mylab.pem file, the command chmod 600 mylab.pem could be used to ensure this. How to set file permissions is discussed in more detail in a later chapter. Users might also have private keys configured that are tried automatically, but that discussion is beyond the scope of this section. The References at the end of this section contain links to more information on this topic. NOTE The first time you log in to a new machine, you will be prompted with a warning from ssh that it cannot establish the authenticity of the host: [ user@host ~ ] $ ssh -i mylab.pem remoteuser@remotehost The authenticity of host 'remotehost (192.0.2.42)' can ' t be established. ECDSA key fingerprint is 47 :bf:82:cd:fa:68:06:ee:d8:83:03:1a:bb:29:14:a3. Are you sure you want to continue connecting ( yes/no ) ? yes [ remoteuser@remotehost ~ ] $ Each time you connect to a remote host with ssh, the remote host sends ssh its host key to authenticate itself and to help set up encrypted communication. The ssh command compares that against a list of saved host keys to make sure it has not changed. If the host key has changed, this might indicate that someone is trying to pretend to be that host to hijack the connection which is also known as man-in-the- middle attack. In SSH, host keys protect against man-in-the-middle attacks, these host keys are unique for each server, and they need to be changed periodically and whenever a compromise is suspected. You will get this warning if your local machine does not have a host key saved for the remote host. If you enter yes, the host key that the remote host sent will be accepted and saved for future reference. Login will continue, and you should not see this message again when connecting to this host. If you enter no, the host key will be rejected and the connection closed. If the local machine does have a host key saved and it does not match the one actually sent by the remote host, the connection will automatically be closed with a warning. LOGGING OUT \u00b6 When you are finished using the shell and want to quit, you can choose one of several ways to end the session. You can enter the exit command to terminate the current shell session. Alternatively, finish a session by pressing Ctrl+D . The following is an example of a user logging out of an SSH session: [ remoteuser@remotehost ~ ] $ exit logout Connection to remotehost closed. [ user@host ~ ] $ EXECUTING COMMANDS USING THE BASH SHELL \u00b6 BASIC COMMAND SYNTAX \u00b6 The GNU Bourne-Again Shell ( bash ) is a program that interprets commands typed in by the user. Each string typed into the shell can have up to three parts: the command, options (which usually begin with a - or --), and arguments. Each word typed into the shell is separated from each other with spaces. Commands are the names of programs that are installed on the system. Each command has its own options and arguments. When you are ready to execute a command, press the Enter key. Type each command on a separate line. The command output is displayed before the next shell prompt appears. [ user@host ] $ whoami user [ user@host ] $ If you want to type more than one command on a single line, use the semicolon (;) as a command separator. A semicolon is a member of a class of characters called metacharacters that have special meanings for bash . In this case the output of both commands will be displayed before the next shell prompt appears. The following example shows how to combine two commands (command1 and command2) on the command line. [ user@host ] $ command1 ; command2 EXAMPLES OF SIMPLE COMMANDS \u00b6 The date command displays the current date and time. It can also be used by the superuser to set the system clock. An argument that begins with a plus sign (+) specifies a format string for the date command. [ user@host ~ ] $ date Sat Jan 26 08 :13:50 IST 2019 [ user@host ~ ] $ date +%R 08 :13 [ user@host ~ ] $ date +%x 01 /26/2019 The passwd command changes a user's own password. The original password for the account must be specified before a change is allowed. By default, passwd is configured to require a strong password, consisting of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols, and is not based on a dictionary word. The superuser can use the passwd command to change other users' passwords. [ user@host ~ ] $ passwd Changing password for user user. Current password: old_password New password: new_password Retype new password: new_password passwd: all authentication tokens updated successfully. Linux does not require file name extensions to classify files by type. The file command scans the beginning of a file's contents and displays what type it is. The files to be classified are passed as arguments to the command. [ user@host ~ ] $ file /etc/passwd /etc/passwd: ASCII text [ user@host ~ ] $ file /bin/passwd /bin/passwd: setuid ELF 64 -bit LSB shared object, x86-64, version 1 ( SYSV ) , dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, for GNU/Linux 3 .2.0, BuildID [ sha1 ]= a3637110e27e9a48dced9f38b4ae43388d32d0e4, stripped [ user@host ~ ] $ file /home /home: directory VIEWING THE CONTENTS OF FILES \u00b6 One of the most simple and frequently used commands in Linux is cat . The cat command allows you to create single or multiple files, view the contents of files, concatenate the contents from multiple files, and redirect contents of the file to a terminal or files. The example shows how to view the contents of the /etc/passwd file. [ user@host ~ ] $ cat /etc/passwd root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash bin:x:1:1:bin:/bin:/sbin/nologin daemon:x:2:2:daemon:/sbin:/sbin/nologin adm:x:3:4:adm:/var/adm:/sbin/nologin ...output omitted... Use the following command to display the contents of multiple files. [ user@host ~ ] $ cat file1 file2 Hello World!! Introduction to Linux commands. Some files are very long and can take up more room to display than that provided by the terminal. The cat command does not display the contents of a file as pages. The less command displays one page of a file at a time and lets you scroll at your leisure. The less command allows you to page forward and backward through files that are longer than can fit on one terminal window. Use the UpArrow key and the DownArrow key to scroll up and down. Press Q to exit the command. The head and tail commands display the beginning and end of a file, respectively. By default these commands display 10 lines of the file, but they both have a -n option that allows a different number of lines to be specified. The file to display is passed as an argument to these commands. [ user@host ~ ] $ head /etc/passwd root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash bin:x:1:1:bin:/bin:/sbin/nologin daemon:x:2:2:daemon:/sbin:/sbin/nologin adm:x:3:4:adm:/var/adm:/sbin/nologin lp:x:4:7:lp:/var/spool/lpd:/sbin/nologin sync:x:5:0:sync:/sbin:/bin/sync shutdown:x:6:0:shutdown:/sbin:/sbin/shutdown halt:x:7:0:halt:/sbin:/sbin/halt mail:x:8:12:mail:/var/spool/mail:/sbin/nologin operator:x:11:0:operator:/root:/sbin/nologin [ user@host ~ ] $ tail -n 3 /etc/passwd gdm:x:42:42::/var/lib/gdm:/sbin/nologin gnome-initial-setup:x:977:977::/run/gnome-initial-setup/:/sbin/nologin avahi:x:70:70:Avahi mDNS/DNS-SD Stack:/var/run/avahi-daemon:/sbin/nologin The wc command counts lines, words, and characters in a file. It takes a -l, -w, or -c option to [ user@host ~ ] $ wc /etc/passwd 45 102 2480 /etc/passwd [ user@host ~ ] $ wc -l /etc/passwd ; wc -l /etc/group 45 /etc/passwd 70 /etc/group [ user@host ~ ] $ wc -c /etc/group /etc/hosts 966 /etc/group 516 /etc/hosts 1482 total CONTINUING A LONG COMMAND ON ANOTHER LINE \u00b6 Commands that support many options and arguments can quickly grow quite long and are automatically scrolled by the Bash shell. As soon as the cursor reaches the right margin of the window, the command continues on the next line. To make the readability of the command easier, you can break it up so that if fits on more than one line. To do this, add a backslash character () as the last character on the line. This tells the shell to ignore the newline character and treat the next line as if it were part of the current line. The Bash shell will start the next line with the continuation prompt, usually a greater-than character (>), which indicates that the line is a continuation of the previous line. You can do this more than once. [ user@host ] $ head -n 3 \\ > /usr/share/dict/words \\ > /usr/share/dict/linux.words == > /usr/share/dict/words < == 1080 10 -point 10th == > /usr/share/dict/linux.words < == 1080 10 -point 10th [ user@host ~ ] $ COMMAND HISTORY \u00b6 The history command displays a list of previously executed commands prefixed with a command number. The exclamation point character (!) is a metacharacter that is used to expand previous commands without having to retype them. The !number command expands to the command matching the number specified. The !string command expands to the most recent command that begins with the string specified. [ user@host ~ ] $ history ...output omitted... 23 clear 24 who 25 pwd 26 ls /etc 27 uptime 28 ls -l 29 date 30 history [ user@host ~ ] $ !ls ls -l total 0 drwxr-xr-x. 2 user user 6 Mar 29 21 :16 Desktop ...output omitted... [ user@host ~ ] $ !26 ls /etc abrt hosts pulse adjtime hosts.allow purple aliases hosts.deny qemu-ga ...output omitted... The arrow keys can be used to navigate through previous commands in the shell's history. UpArrow edits the previous command in the history list. DownArrow edits the next command in the history list. LeftArrow and RightArrow move the cursor left and right in the current command from the history list, so that you can edit it before running it. You can use either the Esc+ . or Alt+ . key combination to insert the last word of the previous command at the cursor's current location. Repeated use of the key combination will replace that text with the last word of even earlier commands in the history. The Alt+. key combination is particularly convenient because you can hold down Alt and press . repeatedly to easily go through earlier and earlier commands. EDITING THE COMMAND LINE \u00b6 When used interactively, bash has a command-line editing feature. This allows the user to use text editor commands to move around within and modify the current command being typed. Using the arrow keys to move within the current command and to step through the command history was introduced earlier in this session. More powerful editing commands are introduced in the following table. Useful Command-line Editing Shortcuts SHORTCUT DESCRIPTION Ctrl+A Jump to the beginning of the command line. Ctrl+E Jump to the end of the command line. Ctrl+U Clear from the cursor to the beginning of the command line. Ctrl+K Clear from the cursor to the end of the command line. Ctrl+Left Arrow Jump to the beginning of the previous word on the command line. Ctrl+Right Arrow Jump to the end of the next word on the command line. Ctrl+R Search the history list of commands for a pattern. There are several other command-line editing commands available, but these are the most useful commands for new users. The other commands can be found in the bash(1) man page. ACCESSING THE COMMAND LINE \u00b6 Use the date command to display the current time and date. [ student@workstation ~ ] $ date Thu Jan 22 10 :13:04 PDT 2019 Display the current time in 12-hour clock time (for example, 11:42:11 AM). Hint: The format string that displays that output is %r. Use the +%r argument with the date command to display the current time in 12-hour clock time. [ student@workstation ~ ] $ date +%r 10 :14:07 AM What kind of file is /home/student/zcat? Is it readable by humans? Use the file command to determine its file type. [ student@workstation ~ ] $ file zcat zcat: POSIX shell script, ASCII text executable Use the wc command and Bash shortcuts to display the size of zcat. The wc command can be used to display the number of lines, words, and bytes in the zcat script. Instead of retyping the file name, use the Bash history shortcut Esc+. (the keys Esc and . pressed at the same time) to reuse the argument from the previous command. [ student@workstation ~ ] $ wc Esc+. [ student@workstation ~ ] $ wc zcat Display the first 10 lines of zcat. The head command displays the beginning of the file. Try using the Esc+. shortcut again. [ student@workstation ~ ] $ head Esc+. [ student@workstation ~ ] $ head zcat #!/bin/sh # Uncompress files to standard output. # Copyright (C) 2007, 2010-2018 Free Software Foundation, Inc. # This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify # it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by # the Free Software Foundation; either version 3 of the License, or # (at your option) any later version. Display the last 10 lines of the zcat file. Use the tail command to display the last 10 lines of the zcat file. [ student@workstation ~ ] $ tail Esc+. [ student@workstation ~ ] $ tail zcat With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input. Report bugs to <bug-gzip@gnu.org>. \" case $1 in --help) printf '%s\\n' \" $usage \" || exit 1;; --version) printf '%s\\n' \" $version \" || exit 1;; esac exec gzip -cd \" $@ \" Repeat the previous command exactly with three or fewer keystrokes. Repeat the previous command exactly. Either press the UpArrow key once to scroll back through the command history one command and then press Enter (uses two keystrokes), or enter the shortcut command !! and then press Enter (uses three keystrokes) to run the most recent command in the command history . (Try both.) [ student@workstation ] $ !! tail zcat With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input. Report bugs to <bug-gzip@gnu.org>. \" case $1 in --help) printf '%s\\n' \" $usage \" || exit 1;; --version) printf '%s\\n' \" $version \" || exit 1;; esac exec gzip -cd \" $@ \" Repeat the previous command, but use the -n 20 option to display the last 20 lines in the file. Use command-line editing to accomplish this with a minimal number of keystrokes. UpArrow displays the previous command. Ctrl+A makes the cursor jump to the beginning of the line. Ctrl+RightArrow jumps to the next word, then add the -n 20 option and hit Enter to execute the command. [ student@workstation ~ ] $ tail -n 20 zcat -l, --list list compressed file contents -q, --quiet suppress all warnings -r, --recursive operate recursively on directories -S, --suffix = SUF use suffix SUF on compressed files --synchronous synchronous output ( safer if system crashes, but slower ) -t, --test test compressed file integrity -v, --verbose verbose mode --help display this help and exit --version display version information and exit With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input. Report bugs to <bug-gzip@gnu.org>. \" case $1 in --help) printf '%s\\n' \" $usage \" || exit 1; exit;; --version) printf '%s\\n' \" $version \" || exit 1; exit;; esac exec gzip -cd \" $@ \" Use the shell history to run the date +%r command again. Use the history command to display the list of previous commands and to identify the specific date command to be executed. Use !number to run the command, where number is the command number to use from the output of the history command. Note that your shell history may be different from the following example. Determine the command number to use based on the output of your own history command. [ student@workstation ~ ] $ history 1 date 2 date +%r 3 file zcat 4 wc zcat 5 head zcat 6 tail zcat 7 tail -n 20 zcat 8 history [ student@workstation ~ ] $ !2 date +%r 10 :49:56 AM SUMMARY \u00b6 In this chapter, you learned: The Bash shell is a command interpreter that prompts interactive users to specify Linux commands. Many commands have a --help option that displays a usage message or screen. Using workspaces makes it easier to organize multiple application windows. The Activities button located at the upper-left corner of the top bar provides an overview mode that helps a user organize windows and start applications. The file command scans the beginning of a file's contents and displays what type it is. The head and tail commands display the beginning and end of a file, respectively. You can use Tab completion to complete file names when typing them as arguments to commands.","title":"Accessing The Command Line"},{"location":"redhat/access/#introduction-to-the-bash-shell","text":"A command line is a text-based interface which can be used to input instructions to a computer system. The Linux command line is provided by a program called the shell. Various options for the shell program have been developed over the years, and different users can be configured to use different shells. Most users, however, stick with the current default. The default shell for users in Red Hat Enterprise Linux is the GNU Bourne-Again Shell (bash) . Bash is an improved version of one of the most successful shells used on UNIX-like systems, the Bourne Shell (sh) . When a shell is used interactively, it displays a string when it is waiting for a command from the user. This is called the shell prompt. When a regular user starts a shell, the default prompt ends with a $ character, as shown below. [ user@host ~ ] $ The $ character is replaced by a # character if the shell is running as the superuser, root. This makes it more obvious that it is a superuser shell, which helps to avoid accidents and mistakes which can affect the whole system. The superuser shell prompt is shown below. [ root@host ~ ] # Using bash to execute commands can be powerful. The bash shell provides a scripting language that can support automation of tasks. The shell has additional capabilities that can simplify or make possible operations that are hard to accomplish efficiently with graphical tools. NOTE The bash shell is similar in concept to the command-line interpreter found in recent versions of Microsoft Windows, cmd.exe, although bash has a more sophisticated scripting language. It is also similar to Windows PowerShell in Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 and later.

Linux is in widespread use, and if you use the internet at all, you are probably already interacting with Linux systems in your daily life. Perhaps the most obvious way in which you interact with Linux systems is through browsing the World Wide Web and using e-commerce sites to buy and sell products. However, Linux is in use for much more than that. Linux manages point-of-sale systems and the world's stock markets, and also powers smart TVs and in-flight entertainment systems. It powers most of the top 500 supercomputers in the world. Linux provides the foundational technologies powering the cloud revolution and the tools used to build the next generation of container-based microservices applications, software-based storage technologies, and big data solutions. In the modern data center, Linux and Microsoft Windows are the major players, and Linux is a growing segment in that space. Some of the many reasons to learn Linux include: A Windows user needs to interoperate with Linux. In application development, Linux hosts the application or its runtime. In cloud computing, the cloud instances in the private or public cloud environment use Linux as the operating system. With mobile applications or the Internet of Things (IoT), the chances are high that the operating system of your device uses Linux. If you are looking for new opportunities in IT, Linux skills are in high demand. WHAT MAKES LINUX GREAT? \u00b6 There are many different answers to the question \"What makes Linux great?\", however, three of them are: Linux is open source software. Being open source does not just mean that you can see how the system works. You can also experiment with changes and share them freely for others to use. The open source model means that improvements are easier to make, enabling faster innovation. Linux provides easy access to a powerful and scriptable command-line interface (CLI). Linux was built around the basic design philosophy that users can perform all administration tasks from the CLI. It enables easier automation, deployment, and provisioning, and simplifies both local and remote system administration. Unlike other operating systems, these capabilities have been built in from the beginning, and the assumption has always been to enable these important capabilities. Linux is a modular operating system that allows you to easily replace or remove components. Components of the system can be upgraded and updated as needed. A Linux system can be a general-purpose development workstation or an extremely stripped-down software appliance. WHAT IS OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE? \u00b6 Open source software is software with source code that anyone can use, study, modify, and share. Source code is the set of human-readable instructions that are used to make a program. It may be interpreted as a script or compiled into a binary executable which the computer runs directly. Upon creating source code, it gets copyrighted, and the copyright holder controls the terms under which the software can be copied, adapted, and distributed. Users can use this software under a software license. Some software has source code that only the person, team, or organization that created it can see, or change, or distribute. This software is sometimes called \"proprietary\" or \"closed source\" software. Typically the license only allows the end user to run the program, and provides no access, or tightly limited access, to the source. Open source software is different. When the copyright holder provides software under an open source license, they grant the user the right to run the program and also to view, modify, compile, and redistribute the source royalty-free to others. Open source promotes collaboration, sharing, transparency, and rapid innovation because it encourages people beyond the original developers to make modifications and improvements to the software and to share it with others. Just because the software is open source does not mean it is somehow not able to be used or provided commercially. Open source is a critical part of many organizations' commercial operations. Some open source licenses allow code to be reused in closed source products. One can sell open source code, but the terms of true open source licenses generally allow the customer to redistribute the source code. Most commonly, vendors such as Red Hat provide commercial help with deploying, supporting, and extending solutions based on open source products. Open source has many benefits for the user: Control : See what the code does and change it to improve it. Training : Learn from real-world code and develop more useful applications. Security : Inspect sensitive code, fix with or without the original developers' help. Stability : Code can survive the loss of the original developer or distributor. The bottom line is that open source allows the creation of better software with a higher return on investment by collaboration. TYPES OF OPEN SOURCE LICENSES \u00b6 There is more than one way to provide open source software. The terms of the software license control how the source can be combined with other code or reused, and hundreds of different open source licenses exist. However, to be open source, licenses must allow users to freely use, view, change, compile, and distribute the code. There are two broad classes of open source license that are particularly important: Copyleft licenses that are designed to encourage keeping code open source. Permissive licenses that are designed to maximize code reusability. Copyleft, or \"share-alike\" licenses, require that anyone who distributes the source code, with or without changes, must also pass along the freedom for others to also copy, change, and distribute the code. The basic advantage of these licenses is that they help to keep existing code, and improvements to that code, open and add to the amount of open source code available. Common copyleft licenses include the GNU General Public License (GPL) and the Lesser GNU Public License (LGPL). Permissive licenses are intended to maximize the reusability of source code. Users can use the source for any purpose as long as the copyright and license statements are preserved, including reusing that code under more restrictive or even proprietary licenses. This makes it very easy for this code to be reused, but at the risk of encouraging proprietary-only enhancements. Several commonly used permissive open source licenses include the MIT/X11 license, the Simplified BSD license, and the Apache Software License 2.0. WHO DEVELOPS OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE? \u00b6 It is a misconception to think that open source is developed solely by an \"army of volunteers\" or even an army of individuals plus Red Hat. Open source development today is overwhelmingly professional. Many developers are paid by their organizations to work with open source projects to construct and contribute the enhancements they and their customers need. Volunteers and the academic community play a significant role and can make vital contributions, especially in new technology areas. The combination of formal and informal development provides a highly dynamic and productive environment. WHO IS RED HAT? \u00b6 Red Hat is the world's leading provider of open source software solutions, using a community- powered approach to reliable and high-performance cloud, Linux, middleware, storage, and virtualization technologies. Red Hat's mission is to be the catalyst in communities of customers, contributors, and partners creating better technology the open source way. Red Hat's role is to help customers connect with the open source community and their partners to effectively use open source software solutions. Red Hat actively participates in and supports the open source community and many years of experience have convinced the company of the importance of open source to the future of the IT industry. Red Hat is most well-known for their participation in the Linux community and the Red Hat Enterprise Linux distribution. However, Red Hat is also very active in other open source communities, including middleware projects centered on the JBoss developer community, virtualization solutions, cloud technologies such as OpenStack and OpenShift, and the Ceph and Gluster software-based storage projects, among others. WHAT IS A LINUX DISTRIBUTION? \u00b6 A Linux distribution is an installable operating system constructed from a Linux kernel and supporting user programs and libraries. A complete Linux operating system is not developed by a single organization, but by a collection of independent open source development communities working with individual software components. A distribution provides an easy way for users to install and manage a working Linux system. In 1991, a young computer science student named Linus Torvalds developed a Unix-like kernel he named Linux, licensed as open source software under the GPL. The kernel is the core component of the operating system, which manages hardware, memory, and the scheduling of running programs. This Linux kernel could then be supplemented with other open source software, such as utilities and programs from the GNU Project, the graphical interface from MIT's X Window System, and many other open source components, such as the Sendmail mail server or the Apache HTTP web server, in order to build a complete open source Unix-like operating system. However, one of the challenges for Linux users was to assemble all these pieces from many different sources. Very early in its history, Linux developers began working to provide a distribution of prebuilt and tested tools that users could download and use to set up their Linux systems quickly. Many different Linux distributions exist, with differing goals and criteria for selecting and supporting the software provided by their distribution. However, distributions generally have many common characteristics: Distributions consist of a Linux kernel and supporting user space programs. Distributions can be small and single-purpose or include thousands of open source programs. Distributions must provide a means of installing and updating the distribution and its components. The provider of the distribution must support that software, and ideally, be participating directly in the community developing that software. Red Hat Enterprise Linux is Red Hat's commercialized Linux distribution. SUMMARY \u00b6 In this chapter, you learned: Open source software is software with source code that anyone can freely use, study, modify, and share. A Linux distribution is an installable operating system constructed from a Linux kernel and supporting user programs and libraries. Red Hat participates in supporting and contributing code to open source projects, sponsors and integrates project software into community-driven distributions, and stabilizes the software to offer it as supported enterprise-ready products. Red Hat Enterprise Linux is Red Hat's open source, enterprise-ready, commercially-supported Linux distribution.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"redhat/intro/#red-hat-system-administration-i","text":"Red Hat System Administration I (RH124) is designed for IT professionals without previous Linux system administration experience.

Common copyleft licenses include the GNU General Public License (GPL) and the Lesser GNU Public License (LGPL). Permissive licenses are intended to maximize the reusability of source code. Users can use the source for any purpose as long as the copyright and license statements are preserved, including reusing that code under more restrictive or even proprietary licenses. This makes it very easy for this code to be reused, but at the risk of encouraging proprietary-only enhancements. Several commonly used permissive open source licenses include the MIT/X11 license, the Simplified BSD license, and the Apache Software License 2.0.","title":"TYPES OF OPEN SOURCE LICENSES"},{"location":"redhat/intro/#who-develops-open-source-software","text":"It is a misconception to think that open source is developed solely by an \"army of volunteers\" or even an army of individuals plus Red Hat. Open source development today is overwhelmingly professional. Many developers are paid by their organizations to work with open source projects to construct and contribute the enhancements they and their customers need. Volunteers and the academic community play a significant role and can make vital contributions, especially in new technology areas. The combination of formal and informal development provides a highly dynamic and productive environment.","title":"WHO DEVELOPS OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE?"},{"location":"redhat/intro/#who-is-red-hat","text":"Red Hat is the world's leading provider of open source software solutions, using a community- powered approach to reliable and high-performance cloud, Linux, middleware, storage, and virtualization technologies.

A complete Linux operating system is not developed by a single organization, but by a collection of independent open source development communities working with individual software components. A distribution provides an easy way for users to install and manage a working Linux system. In 1991, a young computer science student named Linus Torvalds developed a Unix-like kernel he named Linux, licensed as open source software under the GPL. The kernel is the core component of the operating system, which manages hardware, memory, and the scheduling of running programs. This Linux kernel could then be supplemented with other open source software, such as utilities and programs from the GNU Project, the graphical interface from MIT's X Window System, and many other open source components, such as the Sendmail mail server or the Apache HTTP web server, in order to build a complete open source Unix-like operating system. However, one of the challenges for Linux users was to assemble all these pieces from many different sources. Very early in its history, Linux developers began working to provide a distribution of prebuilt and tested tools that users could download and use to set up their Linux systems quickly. Many different Linux distributions exist, with differing goals and criteria for selecting and supporting the software provided by their distribution. However, distributions generally have many common characteristics: Distributions consist of a Linux kernel and supporting user space programs. Distributions can be small and single-purpose or include thousands of open source programs. Distributions must provide a means of installing and updating the distribution and its components. The provider of the distribution must support that software, and ideally, be participating directly in the community developing that software. Red Hat Enterprise Linux is Red Hat's commercialized Linux distribution.","title":"WHAT IS A LINUX DISTRIBUTION?"},{"location":"redhat/intro/#summary","text":"In this chapter, you learned: Open source software is software with source code that anyone can freely use, study, modify, and share.

Image files commonly include Exif data, and sometimes photos even include GPS coordinates within its metadata. While there are plenty of metadata removal tools, they typically aren't convenient to use. The guides featured here aim to detail how to integrate metadata removal tools in a simple fashion by utilizing easy-to-access system features. Recommended metadata removal tools macOS \u00b6 This guide uses the Shortcuts app to add an ExifTool script to the Quick Actions context menu within Finder. Shortcuts is developed by Apple and bundled in with macOS by default. Shortcuts is quite intuitive to work with, so if you don't like the behavior demoed here then experiment with your own solution. For example, you could set the shortcut to take a clipboard input instead. The sky's the limit.
