* OpenSSH is remote management tool, that gives you access to run commands on another machine

* Developed by OpenBSD project

* It's a suite of utilities, the most important of which are the server and client components

* You should have ssh client already installed, this ssh client will give ability to connect to a romote server
but having ssh client doesn't give permission to outside of your network connect to your machine.

* Ssh client allows to connect to other servers but doesn't let anyone connect to you

**Check if ssh is installed**
```bash
which ssh
```
