## cron

Cron is a utility program that lets users input commands for scheduling tasks repeatedly at a specific time. Tasks scheduled in cron are called cron jobs. Users can determine what kind of task they want to automate and when it should be executed.

Cron is a daemon â€“ a background process executing non-interactive jobs. In Windows, you might be familiar with background processes such as Services that work similarly to the cron daemon.

## anacron

Anacron is used to run commands periodically with a frequency defined in days. It works a little different from cron; assumes that a machine will not be powered on all the time.

It is appropriate for running daily, weekly, and monthly scheduled jobs normally run by cron, on machines that will not run 24-7 such as laptops and desktops machines.
